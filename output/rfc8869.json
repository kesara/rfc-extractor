    "abstract": "The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a common transport choice\\nfor interactive multimedia communication applications.  The\\nperformance of these applications typically depends on a well-\\nfunctioning congestion control algorithm.  To ensure a seamless and\\nrobust user experience, a well-designed RTP-based congestion control\\nalgorithm should work well across all access network types.  This\\ndocument describes test cases for evaluating performances of\\ncandidate congestion control algorithms over cellular and Wi-Fi\\nnetworks.",

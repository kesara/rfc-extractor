    "abstract": "There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within a limited region of the Internet.  Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the style of network management, and security requirements may vary between such limited regions.  This document reviews examples of such limited domains (also known as controlled environments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy.  It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains.  Finally, it shows the need for a precise definition of \"limited domain membership\" and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary nodes.  This document is the product of the research of the authors.  It has been produced through discussions and consultation within the IETF but is not the product of IETF consensus. ",

    "abstract": "This specification defines a method for computing a hash value over a CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) Key. It specifies which fields within the COSE Key structure are included in the cryptographic hash computation, the process for creating a canonical representation of these fields, and how to hash the resulting byte sequence.  The resulting hash value, referred to as a \"thumbprint\", can be used to identify or select the corresponding key. ",

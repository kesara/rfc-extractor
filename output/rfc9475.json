    "abstract": "Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of\\nattesting the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in\\norder to prevent impersonation of a calling party number, which is a\\nkey enabler for illegal robocalling.  Similar impersonation is\\nsometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text and multimedia\\nmessaging space.  This document explores the applicability of STIR's\\nPersonal Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance\\nframework to text and multimedia messaging use cases, including\\nsupport for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests and\\nmessages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the\\nneed for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also\\nsuitable for constrained devices.  Ensuring that devices function and\\nremain secure over their service lifetime requires such an update\\nmechanism to fix vulnerabilities, update configuration settings, and\\nadd new functionality.\\n\\nOne component of such a firmware update is a concise and machine-\\nprocessable metadata document, or manifest, that describes the\\nfirmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection.  This document\\ndescribes the information that must be present in the manifest.",

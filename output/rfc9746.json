    "abstract": "An Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is commonly used with\\nNetwork Virtualization Overlay (NVO) tunnels as well as with MPLS and\\nSegment Routing (SR) tunnels.  The multihoming procedures in EVPN may\\nvary based on the type of tunnel used within the EVPN Broadcast\\nDomain.  Specifically, there are two multihoming split-horizon\\nprocedures designed to prevent looped frames on multihomed Customer\\nEdge (CE) devices: the Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) Label-based\\nprocedure and the local-bias procedure.  The ESI Label-based split-\\nhorizon procedure is applied to MPLS-based tunnels such as MPLS over\\nUDP (MPLSoUDP), while the local-bias procedure is used for other\\ntunnels such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)\\ntunnels.\\n\\nCurrent specifications do not allow operators to choose which split-\\nhorizon procedure to use for tunnel encapsulations that support both\\nmethods.  Examples of tunnels that may support both procedures\\ninclude MPLSoUDP, MPLS over GRE (MPLSoGRE), Generic Network\\nVirtualization Encapsulation (Geneve), and Segment Routing over IPv6\\n(SRv6) tunnels.  This document updates the EVPN multihoming\\nprocedures described in RFCs 7432 and 8365, enabling operators to\\nselect the split-horizon procedure that meets their specific\\nrequirements.",

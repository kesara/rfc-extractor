    "abstract": "This document describes SPAKE2, which is a protocol for two parties that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password.  This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and has a security proof.  This document predated the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) password- authenticated key exchange (PAKE) competition, and it was not selected; however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and other applications, it was felt that publication was beneficial. Applications that need a symmetric PAKE, but are unable to hash onto an elliptic curve at execution time, can use SPAKE2.  This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). ",

    "abstract": "QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client chose is unacceptable.  This document describes a version negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version.  Optionally, if the client's chosen version and the negotiated version share a compatible first flight format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip.  This document updates RFC 8999. ",

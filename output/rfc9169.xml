    "abstract": "The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) and the conventions for including these evidence records in the Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) are expressed using ASN.1.  This document offers alternative ASN.1 modules that conform to the 2002 version of ASN.1 and employ the conventions adopted in RFCs 5911, 5912, and 6268. There are no bits-on-the-wire changes to any of the formats; this is simply a change to the ASN.1 syntax. ",

    "abstract": "The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport\\n(ROUTE) protocol is specified for robust delivery of Application\\nObjects, including Application Objects with real-time delivery\\nconstraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport.\\nApplication Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications\\nthat use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers; for\\nexample, it can be a file, a Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP\\n(DASH) or HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) segment, a WAV audio clip, etc.\\nThe ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications.\\n\\nThe ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast\\ntransport.  Therefore, it can be run over UDP/IP, including multicast\\nIP.  The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying\\nprotocol layer, e.g., to provide security, it can leverage IP\\nsecurity protocols such as IPsec.\\n\\nThis document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used\\nby a variety of services for delivery of Application Objects by\\nspecifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g., by adding or\\nconstraining some features).\\n\\nThis is not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.",

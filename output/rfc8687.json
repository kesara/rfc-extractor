    "abstract": "When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6\\nnetwork, the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched\\nPath (LSP) infrastructure may be duplicated, even if the destination\\nIPv4 and IPv6 addresses belong to the same remote router.  In order\\nto achieve an integrated MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must\\nbe computed over MPLS TE tunnels created using information propagated\\nin another OSPF instance.  This issue is solved by advertising cross-\\naddress family (X-AF) OSPF TE information.\\n\\nThis document describes an update to RFC 5786 that allows for the\\neasy identification of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.",

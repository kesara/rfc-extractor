    "abstract": "This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in\\nwidth-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the \"single\\nbackslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single\\nbackslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-folding has\\noccurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character\\nthat is not a space character ('\u00a0') on the next line.  The second\\nstrategy, called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first\\nstrategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the\\ncontinuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported\\nby the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header\\nenabling automated reconstitution of the original content.",

    "abstract": "This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the \"single backslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character ('\u00a0') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content. ",

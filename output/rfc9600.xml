    "abstract": "Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows a forwarding element to\\nnotify downstream devices, including the destination, of the onset of\\ncongestion without having to drop packets.  This can improve network\\nefficiency through better congestion control without packet drops.\\nThis document extends ECN to TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of\\nLinks (TRILL) switches, including integration with IP ECN, and\\nprovides for ECN marking in the TRILL header extension flags word\\n(RFC 7179).",

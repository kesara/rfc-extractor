    "abstract": "This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract\\nview of the provider network topology that contains the points from\\nwhich its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN,\\nnetwork slices).  Also, the model can be used to retrieve the points\\nwhere the services are actually being delivered to customers\\n(including peer networks).\\n\\nThis document augments the 'ietf-network' data model defined in RFC\\n8345 by adding the concept of Service Attachment Points (SAPs).  The\\nSAPs are the network reference points to which network services, such\\nas Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) or Layer 2 Virtual Private\\nNetwork (L2VPN), can be attached.  One or multiple services can be\\nbound to the same SAP.  Both User-to-Network Interface (UNI) and\\nNetwork-to-Network Interface (NNI) are supported in the SAP data\\nmodel.",

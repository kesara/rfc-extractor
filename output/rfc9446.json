    "abstract": "This memo contains the thoughts and recountings of events that\\ntranspired during and after the release of information about the\\nUnited States National Security Agency (NSA) by Edward Snowden in\\n2013.  There are four perspectives: that of someone who was involved\\nwith sifting through the information to responsibly inform the\\npublic, that of a security area director of the IETF, that of a human\\nrights expert, and that of a computer science and affiliate law\\nprofessor.  The purpose of this memo is to provide some historical\\nperspective, while at the same time offering a view as to what\\nsecurity and privacy challenges the technical community should\\nconsider.  These essays do not represent a consensus view, but that\\nof the individual authors.",

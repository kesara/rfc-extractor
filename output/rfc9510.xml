    "abstract": "Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) utilizes delta time for a number of\\nfunctions.  When using CCNx in environments with constrained nodes or\\nbandwidth-constrained networks, it is valuable to have a compressed\\nrepresentation of delta time.  In order to do so, either accuracy or\\ndynamic range has to be sacrificed.  Since the current uses of delta\\ntime do not require both simultaneously, one can consider a\\nlogarithmic encoding.  This document updates RFC 8609 (\"CCNx messages\\nin TLV Format\") to specify this alternative encoding.\\n\\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\\nResearch Group (ICNRG).",

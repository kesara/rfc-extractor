    "abstract": "Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which\\ndepends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane\\nshould ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of\\nconfiguration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the\\n\"Autonomic Control Plane\", with the primary use as a control plane\\nfor autonomic functions.  It also serves as a \"virtual out-of-band\\nchannel\" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM)\\ncommunications over a network that provides automatically configured,\\nhop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via\\nautomatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured\\nor is misconfigured.",

    "abstract": "This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for\\nnetworks that support service function chaining.  The document\\nintroduces a new BGP address family called the \"Service Function\\nChain (SFC) Address Family Identifier / Subsequent Address Family\\nIdentifier\" (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two Route Types.  One Route Type is\\noriginated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance\\nof a specified service function.  This Route Type also provides\\n\"instructions\" on how to send a packet to the hosting node in a way\\nthat indicates that the service function has to be applied to the\\npacket.  The other Route Type is used by a controller to advertise\\nthe paths of \"chains\" of service functions and give a unique\\ndesignator to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction\\nwith the Network Service Header (NSH) defined in RFC 8300.\\n\\nThis document adopts the service function chaining architecture\\ndescribed in RFC 7665.",

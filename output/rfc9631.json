    "abstract": "This document describes an experiment in which two new IPv6 Routing\\nheaders are implemented and deployed.  Collectively, they are called\\nthe Compact Routing Header (CRH).  Individually, they are called\\nCRH-16 and CRH-32.\\n\\nOne purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the CRH can be\\nimplemented and deployed in a production network.  Another purpose is\\nto demonstrate that the security considerations described in this\\ndocument can be addressed with Access Control Lists (ACLs).  Finally,\\nthis document encourages replication of the experiment.",

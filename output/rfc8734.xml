    "abstract": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool curves were an option for\\nauthentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\\nprotocol version 1.2 but were deprecated by the IETF for use with TLS\\nversion 1.3 because they had little usage.  However, these curves\\nhave not been shown to have significant cryptographical weaknesses,\\nand there is some interest in using several of these curves in TLS\\n1.3.\\n\\nThis document provides the necessary protocol mechanisms for using\\nECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3.  This approach is not endorsed by\\nthe IETF.",

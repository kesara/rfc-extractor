    "abstract": "This document specifies the application of the MPLS loss and delay\\nmeasurement techniques (originally defined in RFCs 6374, 7876, and\\n9341) within Segment Routing (SR) networks that utilize the MPLS data\\nplane, also referred to as Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS).  SR\\nenables the forwarding of packets through an ordered list of\\ninstructions, known as segments, which are imposed at the ingress\\nnode.  This document defines the procedures and extensions necessary\\nto perform accurate measurement of packet loss and delay in SR-MPLS\\nenvironments, ensuring that network operators can effectively measure\\nand maintain the quality of service across their SR-based MPLS\\nnetworks.  This includes coverage of links and end-to-end SR-MPLS\\npaths, as well as SR Policies.",

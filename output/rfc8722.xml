    "abstract": "Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF uses registry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.  This document provides a description of, and the requirements for, these delegated functions.  This document obsoletes RFC 6220 to replace all references to the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model. ",

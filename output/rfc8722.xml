    "abstract": "Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of\\ncommonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To\\nensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent\\nimplementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and\\nassociated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF uses\\nregistry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and\\ntheir associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol\\nparameter, it is current practice for the IETF to delegate the role\\nof Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.  This\\ndocument provides a description of, and the requirements for, these\\ndelegated functions.  This document obsoletes RFC 6220 to replace all\\nreferences to the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and\\nrelated structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.",

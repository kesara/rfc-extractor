    "abstract": "Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and\\nnetworks.  Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration\\ninformation for network and service components, and state information\\nthat will be monitored and tracked.  Data models can be used during\\nthe service and network management life cycle (e.g., service\\ninstantiation, service provisioning, service optimization, service\\nmonitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance).  Data models\\nare also instrumental in the automation of network management, and\\nthey can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic\\nservice creation, delivery, and maintenance.\\n\\nThis document describes a framework for service and network\\nmanagement automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling\\ntechnologies.  This framework is drawn from a network operator\\nperspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus, it can\\naccommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF.",

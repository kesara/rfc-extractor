    "abstract": "The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable\\nof selecting paths through a traffic engineering (TE) network.  These\\npaths may be supplied in response to requests for computation or may\\nbe unsolicited requests issued by the PCE to network elements.  Both\\napproaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the\\ndetails of the computed path.\\n\\nTraffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\\nSpecifications\".  RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification and\\ndescribes how Flow Specification components are used to describe\\ntraffic flows.  RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be\\ndistributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated\\nwith routes.\\n\\nThis document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support\\ndissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate\\nwhat traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.\\n\\nThe extensions defined in this document include the creation, update,\\nand withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to\\ntunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated\\nto the PCE by the Path Computation Client (PCC).  Furthermore, a PCC\\nrequesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request\\nto indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this\\ninto the path computation.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set up\\nin such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally\\ndeployed anchors are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support.\\n\\nThere are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility\\nManagement -- for example, extending network-based mobility protocols\\n(like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility protocols (like\\nMobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows the former\\napproach and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which\\nmobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the\\nmobility anchor and access router).  The mobility anchor and access\\nrouter is an enhanced access router that is also able to operate as a\\nlocal mobility anchor or mobility access gateway on a per-prefix\\nbasis.  The document focuses on the required extensions to\\neffectively support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at\\ndifferent distributed gateways.",

    "abstract": "This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of\\nIPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation\\nSystems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are\\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and\\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document\\nexplains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, for\\nIPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current\\nIPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility management,\\nas well as security and privacy).",

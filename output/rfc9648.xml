    "abstract": "This document specifies a minimal YANG data model for TCP on devices that are configured and managed by network management protocols.  The YANG data model defines a container for all TCP connections and groupings of authentication parameters that can be imported and used in TCP implementations or by other models that need to configure TCP parameters.  The model also includes basic TCP statistics.  The model is compliant with Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342). ",

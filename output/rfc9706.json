    "abstract": "As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach\\nunprecedented levels and bitrates climb to support formats and\\napplications such as 4K, 8K, and Augmented Reality (AR), live\\nstreaming can place a unique type of stress upon network resources.\\nTreeDN is a tree-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) architecture\\ndesigned to address the distinctive scaling challenges of live\\nstreaming to mass audiences.  TreeDN enables operators to offer\\nReplication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at a fraction of the cost of\\ntraditional, unicast-based CDNs -- in some cases, at no additional\\ncost to the infrastructure.  In addition to efficiently utilizing\\nnetwork resources to deliver existing multi-destination traffic, this\\narchitecture also enables new types of content and use cases that\\npreviously were not possible or economically viable using traditional\\nCDN approaches.  Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and\\na democratizing technology that makes content distribution more\\naccessible to more people by dramatically reducing the costs of\\nreplication.",

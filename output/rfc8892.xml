    "abstract": "This document provides guidelines and procedures for those who are\\ndefining, registering, or evaluating definitions of new interface\\ntypes (\"ifType\" values) and tunnel types.  The original definition of\\nthe IANA interface type registry predated the use of IANA\\nConsiderations sections and YANG modules, so some confusion arose\\nover time.  Tunnel types were added later, with the same requirements\\nand allocation policy as interface types.  This document updates RFC\\n2863 and provides updated guidance for these registries.",

    "abstract": "This document summarizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in 2018.  The IASA was revised under a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure by the IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal, and financial structure.  As a result, it also changed the relationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise RFC 2031. ",

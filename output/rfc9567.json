    "abstract": "DNS error reporting is a lightweight reporting mechanism that\\nprovides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS\\nresource records that fail to resolve or validate.  A domain owner or\\nDNS hosting organization can use these reports to improve domain\\nhosting.  The reports are based on extended DNS errors as described\\nin RFC 8914.\\n\\nWhen a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a\\nmisconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative\\nserver may be unaware of this.  To mitigate this lack of feedback,\\nthis document describes a method for a validating resolver to\\nautomatically signal an error to a monitoring agent specified by the\\nauthoritative server.  The error is encoded in the QNAME; thus, the\\nvery act of sending the query is to report the error.",

    "abstract": "Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a\\npacket through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by\\nprepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any\\ninstruction, topological or service based.  SR allows for the\\nenforcement of a flow through any topological path while maintaining\\nper-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.\\n\\nThe Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS\\ndata plane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires a\\nminor extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.\\n\\nThis document illustrates the application of Segment Routing to solve\\nthe BGP Egress Peer Engineering (BGP-EPE) requirement.  The SR-based\\nBGP-EPE solution allows a centralized (Software-Defined Networking,\\nor SDN) controller to program any egress peer policy at ingress\\nborder routers or at hosts within the domain.",

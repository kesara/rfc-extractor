    "abstract": "The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet\\ntechnology by enabling quantum communication between any two points\\non Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be\\nbuilt from the ground up to account for the fundamentally new\\nproperties of quantum entanglement.  The first quantum entanglement\\nnetworks have been realised, but there is no practical proposal for\\nhow to organise, utilise, and manage such networks.  In this\\ndocument, we attempt to lay down the framework and introduce some\\nbasic architectural principles for a quantum internet.  This is\\nintended for general guidance and general interest.  It is also\\nintended to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists\\nand network specialists.  This document is a product of the Quantum\\nInternet Research Group (QIRG).",

    "abstract": "This memo describes an RTP payload format for the Versatile Video\\nCoding (VVC) specification, which was published as both ITU-T\\nRecommendation H.266 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23090-3.  VVC\\nwas developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET).  The RTP\\npayload format allows for packetization of one or more Network\\nAbstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as\\nfragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload\\nformat has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video\\nstreaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other\\napplications.",

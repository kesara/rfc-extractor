It therefore also\\nupdates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall\\npetition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view\\nof increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in\\nface-to-face meetings.  The experiment is of fixed duration and will\\napply to one, or at most two, consecutive Nominating Committee\\ncycles, starting in 2021.  This document temporarily varies the rules\\nin RFC 8713.",

    "abstract": "This document specifies new DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal\\nchannel configuration parameters that can be negotiated between DOTS\\npeers to enable the use of Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Constrained\\nApplication Protocol (CoAP) options.  These options enable robust and\\nfaster transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet\\ninterchanges as well as support for faster recovery should any of the\\nblocks get lost in transmission (especially during DDoS attacks).\\n\\nAlso, this document defines a YANG data model for representing these\\nnew DOTS signal channel configuration parameters.  This model\\naugments the DOTS signal YANG module (\"ietf-dots-signal-channel\")\\ndefined in RFC 9132.",

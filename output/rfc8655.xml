    "abstract": "This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic\\nNetworking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified\\nunicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with\\nextremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network\\ndomain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources\\nfor individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the\\nintermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit\\nroutes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the\\nnetwork topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets\\nover time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in\\nspite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and\\ndelivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time-\\nSensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.",

    "abstract": "This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital\\nSignature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR\\nObject Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  WalnutDSA is a\\nlightweight, quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group\\nTheoretic Cryptography with implementation and computational\\nefficiency of signature verification in constrained environments,\\neven on 8- and 16-bit platforms.\\n\\nThe goal of this publication is to document a way to use the\\nlightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE\\nin a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible\\nimplementations.  As of this publication, the security properties of\\nWalnutDSA have not been evaluated by the IETF and its use has not\\nbeen endorsed by the IETF.\\n\\nWalnutDSA and the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm are trademarks\\nof Veridify Security Inc.",

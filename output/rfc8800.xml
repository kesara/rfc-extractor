    "abstract": "This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate a group of\\nLabel Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path Computation\\nElement Communication Protocol (PCEP) with the purpose of computing\\ndiverse (disjointed) paths for those LSPs.  The proposed extension\\nallows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to advertise to a Path\\nComputation Element (PCE) that a particular LSP belongs to a\\nparticular Disjoint Association Group; thus, the PCE knows that the\\nLSPs in the same group need to be disjoint from each other.",

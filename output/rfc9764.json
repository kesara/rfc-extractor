    "abstract": "The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly\\nused to verify connectivity between two systems.  BFD packets are\\ntypically very small.  It is desirable in some circumstances to know\\nnot only that the path between two systems is reachable, but also\\nthat it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size.  This\\ndocument specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in\\nAsynchronous mode.\\n\\nYANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this\\ndocument.  These YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules\\ndefined in RFC 9314.  The YANG modules in this document conform to\\nthe Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).",

    "abstract": "Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology that enables service\\ndifferentiation within an IP network.  The Flexible Algorithm (FA) is\\nanother mechanism for creating a sub-topology within a topology using\\ndefined topology constraints and computation algorithms.  In order to\\ndeploy Multipoint LDP (mLDP) in a network that supports MTR, FA, or\\nother methods of signaling non-default IGP Algorithms (IPAs), mLDP is\\nrequired to become topology and algorithm aware.  This document\\nspecifies extensions to mLDP to support the use of MTR/IPAs such\\nthat, when building multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs), the LSPs\\ncan follow a particular topology and algorithm.  This document\\nupdates RFC 7307 by allocating eight bits from a previously reserved\\nfield to be used as the \"IPA\" field.",

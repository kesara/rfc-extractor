    "abstract": "Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology that enables service differentiation within an IP network.  The Flexible Algorithm (FA) is another mechanism for creating a sub-topology within a topology using defined topology constraints and computation algorithms.  In order to deploy Multipoint LDP (mLDP) in a network that supports MTR, FA, or other methods of signaling non-default IGP Algorithms (IPAs), mLDP is required to become topology and algorithm aware.  This document specifies extensions to mLDP to support the use of MTR/IPAs such that, when building multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs), the LSPs can follow a particular topology and algorithm.  This document updates RFC 7307 by allocating eight bits from a previously reserved field to be used as the \"IPA\" field. ",

    "abstract": "This specification defines UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers) -- also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) -- and a Uniform Resource Name namespace for UUIDs.  A UUID is 128 bits long and is intended to guarantee uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs were originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System (NCS), later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF's) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms.  This specification is derived from the OSF DCE specification with the kind permission of the OSF (now known as \"The Open Group\"). Information from earlier versions of the OSF DCE specification have been incorporated into this document.  This document obsoletes RFC 4122. ",

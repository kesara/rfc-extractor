    "abstract": "RFC 7854, the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), uses different message\\ntypes for different purposes.  Most of these are structured as Type,\\nLength, Value (TLV).  One message type, the Peer Up message, lacks a\\nset of TLVs defined for its use, instead sharing a namespace with the\\nInitiation message.  Experience has shown that this namespace sharing\\nwas a mistake, as it hampers the extension of the protocol.\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent namespace\\nfor the Peer Up message.  It also updates RFCs 8671 and 9069 by\\nmoving defined codepoints into the newly introduced registry.\\nCompliant implementations of RFCs 7854, 8671, and 9069 also comply\\nwith this specification.",

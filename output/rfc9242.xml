    "abstract": "This document defines a new exchange, called \"Intermediate Exchange\",\\nfor the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  This\\nexchange can be used for transferring large amounts of data in the\\nprocess of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment.  An example\\nof the need to do this is using key exchange methods resistant to\\nQuantum Computers (QCs) for IKE SA establishment.  The Intermediate\\nExchange makes it possible to use the existing IKE fragmentation\\nmechanism (which cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange),\\nhelping to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE messages if they need\\nto be sent before IKEv2 SA is established.",

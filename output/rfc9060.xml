    "abstract": "The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) certificate profile provides a way to attest authority over telephone numbers and related identifiers for the purpose of preventing telephone number spoofing. This specification details how that authority can be delegated from a parent certificate to a subordinate certificate.  This supports a number of use cases, including those where service providers grant credentials to enterprises or other customers capable of signing calls with STIR. ",

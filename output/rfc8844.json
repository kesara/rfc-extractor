    "abstract": "This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of\\nDatagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport\\nProtocol (DTLS-SRTP).  Similar attacks are described on the use of\\nDTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time\\nCommunications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are\\ndifficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the\\nidentity of a communicating peer.  This document defines mitigation\\ntechniques that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy.",

    "abstract": "This document describes a mechanism named \"CCNinfo\" that discovers\\ninformation about the network topology and in-network cache in\\nContent-Centric Networks (CCNs).  CCNinfo investigates 1) the CCN\\nrouting path information per name prefix, 2) the Round-Trip Time\\n(RTT) between the content forwarder and the consumer, and 3) the\\nstates of in-network cache per name prefix.  CCNinfo is useful to\\nunderstand and debug the behavior of testbed networks and other\\nexperimental deployments of CCN systems.\\n\\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\\nResearch Group (ICNRG).  This document represents the consensus view\\nof ICNRG and has been reviewed extensively by several members of the\\nICN community and the RG.  The authors and RG chairs approve of the\\ncontents.  The document is sponsored under the IRTF, is not issued by\\nthe IETF, and is not an IETF standard.  This is an experimental\\nprotocol and the specification may change in the future.",

    "abstract": "Existing traffic-engineering-related link attribute advertisements\\nhave been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  Since the\\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\\nSegment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use\\nof the link attribute advertisements have been defined.  In cases\\nwhere multiple applications wish to make use of these link\\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support application-\\nspecific values for a given attribute, nor do they support indication\\nof which applications are using the advertised value for a given\\nlink.  This document introduces new link attribute advertisements in\\nOSPFv2 and OSPFv3 that address both of these shortcomings.",

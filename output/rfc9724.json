    "abstract": "Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the\\nInternet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might\\nnot always be properly secured, and that their location and actions\\ncan be tracked.  One of the main factors that eases tracking of\\nInternet users is the wide use of long-lasting, and sometimes\\npersistent, identifiers at various protocol layers.  This document\\nfocuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.\\n\\nThere have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802\\nstandards committees to address some of the privacy issues involved.\\nThis document provides an overview of these activities to help\\ncoordinate standardization activities in these bodies.",

    "abstract": "This document describes HyStart++, a simple modification to the slow start phase of congestion control algorithms.  Slow start can overshoot the ideal send rate in many cases, causing high packet loss and poor performance.  HyStart++ uses increase in round-trip delay as a heuristic to find an exit point before possible overshoot.  It also adds a mitigation to prevent jitter from causing premature slow start exit. ",

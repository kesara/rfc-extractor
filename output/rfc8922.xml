    "abstract": "This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network\\nsecurity protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate\\nwith applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement\\nefforts to define and catalog Transport Services by describing the\\ninterfaces required to add security protocols.  This survey is not\\nlimited to protocols developed within the scope or context of the\\nIETF, and those included represent a superset of features a Transport\\nServices system may need to support.",

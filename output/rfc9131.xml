    "abstract": "Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the\\nlink-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and\\nmaintain reachability information.  This document updates RFC 4861 to\\nallow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new\\nIPv6 address is assigned to a node.  It also updates RFC 4861 and\\nrecommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon\\nassigning a new IPv6 address.  These changes will minimize the delay\\nand packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link\\ndestination from a new IPv6 address.",

    "abstract": "IANA has created \"Protocol in the Segment ID Sub-TLV\" and \"Protocol in Label Stack Sub-TLV of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV\" registries under the \"Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters\" registry.  RFC 8287 defines the code points for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocols.  This document specifies the code point to be used in the Segment ID sub-TLV and Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV when the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is OSPFv3.  This document also updates RFC\u00a08287 by clarifying that the existing \"OSPF\" code point is to be used only to indicate OSPFv2 and by defining the behavior when the Segment ID sub-TLV indicates the use of IPv6.

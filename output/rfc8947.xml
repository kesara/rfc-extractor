    "abstract": "In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization\\ndeployments, new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such\\ndevices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated\\nfashion.  With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using\\nrandom assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.\\nTherefore, an allocation mechanism is required.  This document\\nproposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to\\nlink-layer address assignments where preassigned link-layer address\\nassignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or are\\nunnecessary.",

Like the\\nEuropean Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) virus test\\nand the Generic Test for Unsolicited Bulk Email (GTUBE) spam test\\nfiles, these publicly known test keys can be detected and recognised\\nby applications consuming them as being purely for testing purposes\\nwithout assigning any security properties to them.",

    "abstract": "Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any\\npath.  Intermediate per-path states are eliminated thanks to source\\nrouting.  SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e.,\\ninstructions) that represent a source-routed policy.  Packet flows\\nare steered into an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated\\ncalled a headend node.  The packets steered into an SR Policy carry\\nan ordered list of segments associated with that SR Policy.\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 8402 as it details the concepts of SR\\nPolicy and steering into an SR Policy.",

    "abstract": "Path steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of\\nInformation-Centric Networking (ICN) Content Objects and steer\\nsubsequent Interest messages along a previously discovered path.  It\\nhas various uses, including the operation of state-of-the-art multi-\\npath congestion control algorithms and for network measurement and\\nmanagement.  This specification derives directly from the design\\npublished in \"Path Switching in Content Centric and Named Data\\nNetworks\" (4th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking) and,\\ntherefore, does not recapitulate the design motivations,\\nimplementation details, or evaluation of the scheme.  However, some\\ntechnical details are different, and where there are differences, the\\ndesign documented here is to be considered definitive.\\n\\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\\nResearch Group (ICNRG).  It is not an IETF product and is not an\\nInternet Standard.",

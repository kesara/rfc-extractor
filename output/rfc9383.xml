    "abstract": "This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password-Authenticated Key\\nExchange (PAKE) protocol run between two parties for deriving a\\nstrong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.  SPAKE2+\\nis an augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party has knowledge of the\\npassword.  This method is simple to implement, compatible with any\\nprime-order group, and computationally efficient.\\n\\nThis document was produced outside of the IETF and IRTF and\\nrepresents the opinions of the authors.  Publication of this document\\nas an RFC in the Independent Submissions Stream does not imply\\nendorsement of SPAKE2+ by the IETF or IRTF.",

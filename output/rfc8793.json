    "abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm where\\nnetwork communications are accomplished by requesting named content\\ninstead of sending packets to destination addresses.  Named Data\\nNetworking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) are two\\nprominent ICN architectures.  This document provides an overview of\\nthe terminology and definitions that have been used in describing\\nconcepts in these two implementations of ICN.  While there are other\\nICN architectures, they are not part of the NDN and CCNx concepts and\\nas such are out of scope for this document.  This document is a\\nproduct of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).",

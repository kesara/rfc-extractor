    "abstract": "This document specifies alternative Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) block-wise transfer options: Q-Block1 and Q-Block2.  These options are similar to, but distinct from, the CoAP Block1 and Block2 options defined in RFC 7959.  The Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 options are not intended to replace the Block1 and Block2 options but rather have the goal of supporting Non-confirmable (NON) messages for large amounts of data with fewer packet interchanges.  Also, the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 options support faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission. ",

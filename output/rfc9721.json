    "abstract": "This document specifies extensions to the Ethernet VPN Integrated\\nRouting and Bridging (EVPN-IRB) procedures specified in RFCs 7432 and\\n9135 to enhance the mobility mechanisms for networks based on EVPN-\\nIRB.  The proposed extensions improve the handling of host mobility\\nand duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks to cover a\\nbroader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to Media\\nAccess Control (MAC) address bindings may change across moves.  These\\nenhancements address limitations in the existing EVPN-IRB mobility\\nprocedures by providing more efficient and scalable solutions.  The\\nextensions are backward compatible with existing EVPN-IRB\\nimplementations and aim to optimize network performance in scenarios\\ninvolving frequent IP address mobility.",

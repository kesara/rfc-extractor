    "abstract": "The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\\nDefined Networking (SDN) systems.\\n\\nA PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of\\na distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and\\nwithout necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the Label\\nSwitched Path (LSP) can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-\\nforwarding entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE\\nserver to each network device along the path while leveraging the\\nexisting PCE technologies as much as possible.\\n\\nThis document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element\\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the\\ncentral controller for provisioning labels along the path of the\\nstatic LSP.",

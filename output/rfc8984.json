    "abstract": "This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of\\ncalendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a\\ncalendaring and scheduling environment.  It aims to be an alternative\\nand, over time, successor to the widely deployed iCalendar data\\nformat.  It also aims to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to\\nprocess.  In contrast to the jCal format, which is also based on\\nJSON, JSCalendar is not a direct mapping from iCalendar but defines\\nthe data model independently and expands semantics where appropriate.",

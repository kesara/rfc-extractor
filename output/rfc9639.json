    "abstract": "This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and\\nits streamable subset.  FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of\\ncomputer storage space needed to store digital audio signals.  It\\ndoes this losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information.\\nFLAC is free in the sense that its specification is open and its\\nreference implementation is open source.  Compared to other lossless\\naudio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be\\nencoded and decoded with little computing resources.  Decoding of\\nFLAC has been implemented independently for many different platforms,\\nand both encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing\\nfloating-point arithmetic.",

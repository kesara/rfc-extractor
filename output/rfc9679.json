    "abstract": "This specification defines a method for computing a hash value over a\\nCBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) Key. It specifies which\\nfields within the COSE Key structure are included in the\\ncryptographic hash computation, the process for creating a canonical\\nrepresentation of these fields, and how to hash the resulting byte\\nsequence.  The resulting hash value, referred to as a \"thumbprint\",\\ncan be used to identify or select the corresponding key.",

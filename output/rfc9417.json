    "abstract": "This document describes an architecture that provides some assurance\\nthat service instances are running as expected.  As services rely\\nupon multiple subservices provided by a variety of elements,\\nincluding the underlying network devices and functions, getting the\\nassurance of a healthy service is only possible with a holistic view\\nof all involved elements.  This architecture not only helps to\\ncorrelate the service degradation with symptoms of a specific network\\ncomponent but, it also lists the services impacted by the failure or\\ndegradation of a specific network component.",

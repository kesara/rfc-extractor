    "abstract": "Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through a network\\nusing the IPv6 or MPLS data plane, employing the source routing\\nparadigm.\\n\\nAn SR Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an\\nIGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path\\nComputation Element (PCE).\\n\\nSince SR can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes, a PCE\\nshould be able to compute an SR Path for both MPLS and IPv6 data\\nplanes.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\\nextension and mechanisms to support SR-MPLS have been defined.  This\\ndocument outlines the necessary extensions to support SR for the IPv6\\ndata plane within PCEP.",

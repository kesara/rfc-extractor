    "abstract": "HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select\\nthe appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user\\nagent's characteristics, as expressed in request headers.  In\\npractice, user agents are often unwilling to send those request\\nheaders, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and\\nsending them impacts both performance and privacy.\\n\\nThis document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can\\nuse to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content\\nnegotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such\\nheaders, colloquially known as \"Client Hints.\"",

    "abstract": "In many environments, a component external to a network is called\\nupon to perform computations based on the network topology and the\\ncurrent state of the connections within the network, including\\nTraffic Engineering (TE) information.  This is information typically\\ndistributed by IGP routing protocols within the network.\\n\\nThis document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE\\ninformation can be collected from networks and shared with external\\ncomponents using the BGP routing protocol.  This is achieved using a\\nBGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format.\\nThe mechanism applies to physical and virtual (e.g., tunnel) IGP\\nlinks.  The mechanism described is subject to policy control.\\n\\nApplications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic\\nOptimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 7752 by completely replacing that\\ndocument.  It makes some small changes and clarifications to the\\nprevious specification.  This document also obsoletes RFC 9029 by\\nincorporating the updates that it made to RFC 7752.",

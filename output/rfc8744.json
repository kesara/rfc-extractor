    "abstract": "This document describes the general problem of encrypting the Server\\nName Identification (SNI) TLS parameter.  The proposed solutions hide\\na hidden service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI\\nof the fronting service to external observers.  This document lists\\nknown attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current \"HTTP co-\\ntenancy\" solution, and presents requirements for future TLS-layer\\nsolutions.\\n\\nIn practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every\\nrequirement and that practical solutions will have to make some\\ncompromises.",

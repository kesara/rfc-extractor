    "abstract": "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) uses a 32-bit\\nchecksum in the common header of each packet to provide some level of\\ndata integrity.  If another method used by SCTP already provides the\\nsame or a higher level of data integrity, computing this checksum\\ndoes not provide any additional protection but does consume computing\\nresources.\\n\\nThis document provides a simple extension allowing SCTP to save these\\ncomputing resources by using zero as the checksum in a backwards-\\ncompatible way.  It also defines how this feature can be used when\\nSCTP packets are encapsulated in Datagram Transport Layer Security\\n(DTLS) packets.",

    "abstract": "Electronic signatures have a limited lifespan with respect to the\\ntime period that they can be validated and determined to be\\nauthentic.  The Signature Validation Token (SVT) defined in this\\nspecification provides evidence that asserts the validity of an\\nelectronic signature.  The SVT is provided by a trusted authority,\\nwhich asserts that a particular signature was successfully validated\\naccording to defined procedures at a certain time.  Any future\\nvalidation of that electronic signature can be satisfied by\\nvalidating the SVT without any need to also validate the original\\nelectronic signature or the associated digital certificates.  The SVT\\nsupports electronic signatures in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),\\nXML, PDF, and JSON documents.",

    "abstract": "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\\nmultiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-NOOB\\nauthentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and\\nkey derivation.  The EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all\\nkinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that have no preconfigured\\nauthentication credentials.  The method makes use of a user-assisted,\\none-directional, out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer device\\nand authentication server to authenticate the in-band key exchange.\\nThe device must have a nonnetwork input or output interface, such as\\na display, microphone, speaker, or blinking light, that can send or\\nreceive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length.",

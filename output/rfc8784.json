    "abstract": "The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to\\ncryptographic algorithms deployed widely today.  The Internet Key\\nExchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem\\nthat could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could\\ndecrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available.\\nIt is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-\\nsecure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen\\nin the near term.  To address this problem before then, this document\\ndescribes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a\\nquantum computer by using preshared keys.",

    "abstract": "\"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol\" (RFC 7285)\\nleverages HTTP/1.1 and is designed for the simple, sequential\\nrequest-reply use case, in which an ALTO client requests a sequence\\nof information resources and the server responds with the complete\\ncontent of each resource, one at a time.\\n\\nRFC 8895, which describes ALTO incremental updates using Server-Sent\\nEvents (SSE), defines a multiplexing protocol on top of HTTP/1.x, so\\nthat an ALTO server can incrementally push resource updates to\\nclients whenever monitored network information resources change,\\nallowing the clients to monitor multiple resources at the same time.\\nHowever, HTTP/2 and later versions already support concurrent, non-\\nblocking transport of multiple streams in the same HTTP connection.\\n\\nTo take advantage of newer HTTP features, this document introduces\\nthe ALTO Transport Information Publication Service (TIPS).  TIPS uses\\nan incremental RESTful design to give an ALTO client the new\\ncapability to explicitly and concurrently (in a non-blocking manner)\\nrequest (or pull) specific incremental updates using HTTP/2 or\\nHTTP/3, while still functioning for HTTP/1.1.",

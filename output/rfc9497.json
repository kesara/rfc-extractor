    "abstract": "An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol\\nbetween a client and a server for computing the output of a\\nPseudorandom Function (PRF).  The server provides the PRF private\\nkey, and the client provides the PRF input.  At the end of the\\nprotocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything\\nabout the PRF private key, and the server learns neither the PRF\\ninput nor output.  An OPRF can also satisfy a notion of\\n'verifiability', called a VOPRF.  A VOPRF ensures clients can verify\\nthat the server used a specific private key during the execution of\\nthe protocol.  A VOPRF can also be partially oblivious, called a\\nPOPRF.  A POPRF allows clients and servers to provide public input to\\nthe PRF computation.  This document specifies an OPRF, VOPRF, and\\nPOPRF instantiated within standard prime-order groups, including\\nelliptic curves.  This document is a product of the Crypto Forum\\nResearch Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.",

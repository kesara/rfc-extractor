    "abstract": "Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local\\nArea Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into\\nmultiple segments.  Each segment may be located at a different site,\\nand the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone.\\nIntra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to\\nthe end users to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over\\nthe IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns multiple such\\nLANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those\\nLANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet\\nIP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant\\nwhile still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be\\nbridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter-\\nsubnet multicast traffic and do not require any such traffic to\\negress a given router and then ingress that same router.  These\\nprocedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that originates or\\nis destined to be external to the EVPN domain.",

    "abstract": "Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through a network using the IPv6 or MPLS data plane, employing the source routing paradigm.  An SR Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).  Since SR can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes, a PCE should be able to compute an SR Path for both MPLS and IPv6 data planes.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extension and mechanisms to support SR-MPLS have been defined.  This document outlines the necessary extensions to support SR for the IPv6 data plane within PCEP. ",

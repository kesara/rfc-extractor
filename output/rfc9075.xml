    "abstract": "The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused changes in\\nInternet user behavior, particularly during the introduction of\\ninitial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.  These behavior\\nchanges drove changes in Internet traffic.\\n\\nThe Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss\\nnetwork impacts of the pandemic on November 9-13, 2020.  The workshop\\nwas held to convene interested researchers, network operators,\\nnetwork management experts, and Internet technologists to share their\\nexperiences.  The meeting was held online given the ongoing travel\\nand contact restrictions at that time.\\n\\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\\nworkshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\\nthose of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB\\nviews and positions.",

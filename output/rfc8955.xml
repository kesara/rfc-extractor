    "abstract": "This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer\\nReachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used\\nto distribute (intra-domain and inter-domain) traffic Flow\\nSpecifications for IPv4 unicast and IPv4 BGP/MPLS VPN services.  This\\nallows the routing system to propagate information regarding more\\nspecific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP\\ndestination prefix.\\n\\nIt also specifies BGP Extended Community encoding formats, which can\\nbe used to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions along with the Flow\\nSpecification NLRI.  Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode actions a\\nrouting system can take if the packet matches the Flow Specification.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes both RFC 5575 and RFC 7674.",

    "abstract": "Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector\\n(IV) in each packet.  The size of the IV depends on the applied\\ntransform and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at\\nthe time this document was written.  When used with IPsec, some\\nalgorithms, such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the\\nIV to generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for\\nencrypting and decrypting.  This IV must be unique but can be\\npredictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence\\nNumber (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids\\nsending the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of\\nAES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305.  This document describes how\\nto do this.",

    "abstract": "This memo updates the process for selection of Trustees for the IETF\\nTrust.  Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\\n(IAOC) members also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been\\neliminated as part of an update to the structure of the IETF\\nAdministrative Support Activity (IASA).  This memo specifies that the\\nTrustees shall be selected separately.\\n\\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 4371.  The changes relate only to the\\nselection of Trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as\\nthey are today.",

    "abstract": "This document updates RFC 4090 for the Resource Reservation Protocol\\n(RSVP) Traffic Engineering (TE) procedures defined for facility\\nbackup protection.  The updates include extensions that reduce the\\namount of signaling and processing that occurs during Fast Reroute\\n(FRR); as a result, scalability when undergoing FRR convergence after\\na link or node failure is improved.  These extensions allow the RSVP\\nmessage exchange between the Point of Local Repair (PLR) and the\\nMerge Point (MP) nodes to be independent of the number of protected\\nLabel Switched Paths (LSPs) traversing between them when facility\\nbypass FRR protection is used.  The signaling extensions are fully\\nbackwards compatible with nodes that do not support them.",

    "abstract": "This document describes the minimal properties that an IP\\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP) implementation needs to meet to\\nremain interoperable with the standard ESP as defined in RFC 4303.\\nSuch a minimal version of ESP is not intended to become a replacement\\nof ESP in RFC 4303.  Instead, a minimal implementation is expected to\\nbe optimized for constrained environments while remaining\\ninteroperable with implementations of ESP.  In addition, this\\ndocument provides some considerations for implementing minimal ESP in\\na constrained environment, such as limiting the number of flash\\nwrites, handling frequent wakeup and sleep states, limiting wakeup\\ntime, and reducing the use of random generation.\\n\\nThis document does not update or modify RFC 4303.  It provides a\\ncompact description of how to implement the minimal version of that\\nprotocol.  RFC 4303 remains the authoritative description.",

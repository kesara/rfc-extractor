    "abstract": "This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a separate protocol.  This document obsoletes RFC 5661.  It substantially revises the treatment of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding the description of those features appearing in RFC 5661. ",

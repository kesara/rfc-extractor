    "abstract": "This document specifies enhancements to the Constrained Application\\nProtocol (CoAP) that mitigate security issues in particular use\\ncases.  The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness\\nof a request or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its\\nclaimed network address.  The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP\\nserver to match block-wise message fragments belonging to the same\\nrequest.  This document updates RFC 7252 with respect to the\\nfollowing: processing requirements for client Tokens, forbidding non-\\nsecure reuse of Tokens to ensure response-to-request binding when\\nCoAP is used with a security protocol, and amplification mitigation\\n(where the use of the Echo option is now recommended).",

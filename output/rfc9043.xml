    "abstract": "This document defines FFV1, a lossless, intra-frame video encoding format.  FFV1 is designed to efficiently compress video data in a variety of pixel formats.  Compared to uncompressed video, FFV1 offers storage compression, frame fixity, and self-description, which makes FFV1 useful as a preservation or intermediate video format. ",

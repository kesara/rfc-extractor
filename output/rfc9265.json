    "abstract": "Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism that is\\ndistinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable\\ntransfer protocols such as TCP.  FEC coding can help deal with losses\\nat the end of transfers or with networks having non-congestion\\nlosses.  However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion\\nsignals.  This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and\\ncongestion control can coexist.  Another objective is to encourage\\nthe research community to also consider congestion control aspects\\nwhen proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication\\nsystems.\\n\\nThis document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\\nCommunications Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is\\nend-to-end communications; FEC coding for tunnels is out of the scope\\nof the document.",

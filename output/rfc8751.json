    "abstract": "A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on\\nthe current network state received from the Path Computation Clients\\n(PCCs), including computed Label Switched Paths (LSPs), reserved\\nresources within the network, and pending path computation requests.\\nThis information may then be considered when computing the path for a\\nnew traffic-engineered LSP or for any associated/dependent LSPs.  The\\npath-computation response from a PCE helps the PCC to gracefully\\nestablish the computed LSP.\\n\\nThe Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture allows\\nthe optimum sequence of interconnected domains to be selected and\\nnetwork policy to be applied if applicable, via the use of a\\nhierarchical relationship between PCEs.\\n\\nCombining the capabilities of stateful PCE and the hierarchical PCE\\nwould be advantageous.  This document describes general\\nconsiderations and use cases for the deployment of stateful, but not\\nstateless, PCEs using the hierarchical PCE architecture.",

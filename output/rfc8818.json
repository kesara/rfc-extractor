    "abstract": "This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the\\ndifferent configurations and functions to provide IP mobility\\nsupport.  A network may be configured with distributed mobility\\nanchoring functions for both network-based or host-based mobility\\nsupport, depending on the network's needs.  In a distributed mobility\\nanchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session\\nswitching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a\\nflow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a\\nnew network, the flow can be started or restarted using an IP address\\nconfigured from the new IP prefix anchored to the new network.  If\\nthe flow needs to survive the change of network, there are solutions\\nthat can be used to enable IP address mobility.  This document\\ndescribes different anchoring approaches, depending on the IP\\nmobility needs, and how this IP address mobility is handled by the\\nnetwork.",

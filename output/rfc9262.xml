    "abstract": "This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered replication and forwarding for \"Bit Index Explicit Replication\" (BIER) packets (RFC 8279); it is called \"Tree Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication\" (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER.  BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for \"bit positions\" (BPs).  These BPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non- TE) BIER in which BPs indicate \"Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers\" (BFERs).  A BIER-TE \"packets BitString\" therefore indicates the edges of the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by BIER-TE.  BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes.  Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER \"subdomains\" (SDs).  Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such as the \"Interior Gateway Protocol\" (IGP).

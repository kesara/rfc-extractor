    "abstract": "Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each\\nnetwork element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing,\\nand signaling in a distributed manner.\\n\\nThe advancement of software-defined transport networking technology\\nenables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller\\nhierarchies.  This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple\\ndomains, vendors, and technologies.  An example of such a centralized\\narchitecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered\\nNetworks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453.\\n\\nBoth the distributed and centralized control planes have their\\nrespective advantages and should complement each other in the system,\\nrather than compete.  This document outlines how the GMPLS\\ndistributed control plane can work together with a centralized\\ncontroller system in a transport network.",

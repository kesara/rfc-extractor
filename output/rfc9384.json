    "abstract": "The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol (RFC 5880) is\\nused to detect loss of connectivity between two forwarding engines,\\ntypically with low latency.  BFD is leveraged by routing protocols,\\nincluding the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), to bring down routing\\nprotocol connections more quickly than the original protocol timers.\\n\\nThis document defines a subcode for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION\\nmessage (Section\u00a06.7 of RFC 4271) for use when a BGP connection is\\nbeing closed due to a BFD session going down.",

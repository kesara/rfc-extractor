    "abstract": "A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\\nguarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\\nand bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e.,\\n\"jitter\").  As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition\\nto the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical\\nnetwork, additional security measures may be needed to secure the\\nintended operation of these novel service properties.\\n\\nThis document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from\\nthe perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and\\ncomponent designer.  System considerations include a taxonomy of\\nrelevant threats and attacks, and associations of threats versus use\\ncases and service properties.  Component-level considerations include\\ningress filtering and packet arrival-time violation detection.\\n\\nThis document also addresses security considerations specific to the\\nIP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the\\nSecurity Considerations sections of those documents.",

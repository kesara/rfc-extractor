    "abstract": "When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domain names can be resolved authoritatively by a network-provided DNS resolver. DNS clients that are not configured to use this resolver by default can use it for these specific domains only.  This specification defines a mechanism for domain owners to inform DNS clients about local resolvers that are authorized to answer authoritatively for certain subdomains. ",

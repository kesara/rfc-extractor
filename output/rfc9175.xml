    "abstract": "This document specifies enhancements to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that mitigate security issues in particular use cases.  The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its claimed network address.  The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server to match block-wise message fragments belonging to the same request.  This document updates RFC 7252 with respect to the following: processing requirements for client Tokens, forbidding non- secure reuse of Tokens to ensure response-to-request binding when CoAP is used with a security protocol, and amplification mitigation (where the use of the Echo option is now recommended).

    "abstract": "The MPLS ping and traceroute mechanisms described in RFC 8029 and the\\nrelated extensions for Segment Routing (SR) defined in RFC 8287 are\\nhighly valuable for validating control plane and data plane\\nsynchronization.  In certain environments, only some intermediate or\\ntransit nodes may have been upgraded to support these validation\\nprocedures.  A straightforward MPLS ping and traceroute mechanism\\nallows traversal of any path without validation of the control plane\\nstate.  RFC 8029 supports this mechanism with the Nil Forwarding\\nEquivalence Class (FEC).  The procedures outlined in RFC 8029 are\\nprimarily applicable when the Nil FEC is used as an intermediate FEC\\nin the FEC stack.  However, challenges arise when all labels in the\\nlabel stack are represented using the Nil FEC.\\n\\nThis document introduces a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) as an\\nextension to the existing Nil FEC.  It describes MPLS ping and\\ntraceroute procedures using the Nil FEC with this extension to\\naddress and overcome these challenges.",

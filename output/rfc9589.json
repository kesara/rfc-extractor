    "abstract": "In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Signed Objects are\\ndefined as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content\\ntypes.  A Signed Object contains a signing-time attribute,\\nrepresenting the purported time at which the object was signed by its\\nissuer.  RPKI repositories are accessible using the rsync and RPKI\\nRepository Delta protocols, allowing Relying Parties (RPs) to\\nsynchronize a local copy of the RPKI repository used for validation\\nwith the remote repositories.  This document describes how the CMS\\nsigning-time attribute can be used to avoid needless retransfers of\\ndata when switching between different synchronization protocols.\\nThis document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS\\nsigning-time attribute and disallowing the use of the binary-signing-\\ntime attribute.",

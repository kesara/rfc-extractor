    "abstract": "This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy\\nProtocol (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6.  It obsoletes RFC 5798, which\\npreviously specified VRRP (version 3).  RFC 5798 obsoleted RFC 3768,\\nwhich specified VRRP (version 2) for IPv4.  VRRP specifies an\\nelection protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a\\nVirtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The VRRP Router\\ncontrolling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual\\nRouter is called the Active Router, and it forwards packets routed to\\nthese IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with\\nvirtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address\\nfamily of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP\\nprotocol version.  Within a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each\\nof the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are independent of one another\\nand always treated as separate Virtual Router instances.  The\\nelection process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding\\nresponsibility should the Active Router become unavailable.  For\\nIPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability\\ndefault path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or\\nrouter discovery protocols on every end-host.  For IPv6, the\\nadvantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover to\\nBackup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor\\nDiscovery mechanisms.",

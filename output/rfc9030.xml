    "abstract": "This document describes a network architecture that provides low- latency, low-jitter, and high-reliability packet delivery.  It combines a high-speed powered backbone and subnetworks using IEEE 802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) to meet the requirements of low-power wireless deterministic applications. ",

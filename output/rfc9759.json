    "abstract": "Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane,\\nremains a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday\\ncommunication.  Existing models fail due to inherent unpredictability\\nand inconsistencies in human estimation.  This document introduces\\nthe Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable time\\nscale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a\\nsingular, uniform duration.  TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and\\nsynchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based\\nscheduling.",

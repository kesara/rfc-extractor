    "abstract": "The PARTIAL extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (see\\nRFCs 3501 and 9051) allows clients to limit the number of SEARCH\\nresults returned, as well as to perform incremental (paged) searches.\\nThis also helps servers to optimize resource usage when performing\\nsearches.\\n\\nThis document extends the PARTIAL SEARCH return option originally\\nspecified in RFC 5267.  It also clarifies some interactions between\\nRFC 5267 and RFCs 4731 and 9051.\\n\\nThis document updates RFCs 4731 and 5267.",

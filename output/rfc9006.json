    "abstract": "This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the\\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks\\n(CNNs), which are a characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT).\\nSuch environments require a lightweight TCP implementation and may\\nnot make use of optional functionality.  This document explains a\\nnumber of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as\\nwell as corresponding trade-offs.  The objective is to help embedded\\ndevelopers with decisions on which TCP features to use.",

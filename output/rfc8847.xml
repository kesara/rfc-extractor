The design of the CLUE protocol takes\\ninto account the requirements and the framework defined within the\\nIETF CLUE Working Group.  A companion document, RFC 8848, delves into\\nCLUE signaling details as well as the SIP / Session Description\\nProtocol (SDP) session establishment phase.

Message details, together with the behavior of CLUE\\nParticipants acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are\\nherein discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) protocol is an application protocol conceived for the description and negotiation of a telepresence session.  The design of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and the framework defined within the IETF CLUE Working Group.  A companion document, RFC 8848, delves into CLUE signaling details as well as the SIP / Session Description Protocol (SDP) session establishment phase.  CLUE messages flow over the CLUE data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP-over-DTLS transport.  (\"SCTP\" stands for \"Stream Control Transmission Protocol\".)  Message details, together with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are herein discussed. ",

    "abstract": "This document provides Path Computation Element Communication\\nProtocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength\\nAssignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).\\nPath provisioning in WSONs requires an RWA process.  From a path\\ncomputation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of\\ndetermining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and\\nforms an additional routing constraint to optical path computation.",

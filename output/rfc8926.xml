    "abstract": "Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a\\nwide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel\\nendpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a\\nresult of their role in tying together different elements of the\\nsystem, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these\\ncomponents.  Therefore, flexibility is the most important aspect of a\\ntunneling protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of\\ntechnology.  This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation\\nprotocol designed to recognize and accommodate these changing\\ncapabilities and needs.",

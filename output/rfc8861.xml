    "abstract": "RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but\\nrequires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control\\nProtocol (RTCP) reception quality reports for every other SSRC\\nvisible in the session.  This causes the number of RTCP reception\\nreports to grow with the number of SSRCs, rather than the number of\\nendpoints.  In many cases, most of these RTCP reception reports are\\nunnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are normally co-located\\nand see the same reception quality.  This memo defines a Reporting\\nGroup extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting overhead in such\\nscenarios.",

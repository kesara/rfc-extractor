This document defines a bit called the Host-bit\\n(H-bit).  This bit enables a router to advertise that it is a non-\\ntransit router.  This document also describes the changes needed to\\nsupport the H-bit in the domain.  In addition, this document updates\\nRFC 6987 to advertise Type 2 External and Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)\\nLink State Advertisements (LSAs) (RFC 3101) with a high cost in order\\nto repel traffic effectively.",

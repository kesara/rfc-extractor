    "abstract": "This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified\\nin RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model,\\nenabling source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission\\nof text from different sources.  The intended use is for real-time\\ntext mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an\\nefficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time\\ntext session.  The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of\\nthe Contributing Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport\\nProtocol (RTP) packet for source identification.  The method makes\\nuse of the same \"text/t140\" and \"text/red\" formats as for two-party\\nsessions.\\n\\nSolutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are\\nbriefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP-\\nmixer model.  The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the\\nfully specified solution in this document because it can be applied\\nto a wide range of existing RTP implementations.\\n\\nA capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a\\nmixer and a participant can handle the multiparty-coded real-time\\ntext stream using the RTP-mixer method.  The capability is indicated\\nby the use of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media\\nattribute, \"rtt-mixer\".\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 4103 (\"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\").\\n\\nA specification for how a mixer can format text for the case when the\\nendpoint is not multiparty aware is also provided.",

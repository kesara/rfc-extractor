    "abstract": "This is a position paper.  It documents the author's personal views\\non how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated\\nin Information-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-\\nCentric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which\\nemploy flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop\\nforwarding state as their fundamental machinery.  It argues that such\\nprotocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that\\ntaken in TCP/IP and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both\\nclassification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and\\naggregate basis.  It also considers the effect of caches in addition\\nto memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should be\\nsubject to explicitly unfair resource allocation.  The proposed\\nmethods are intended to operate purely at the network layer,\\nproviding the primitives needed to achieve transport- and higher-\\nlayer QoS objectives.  It explicitly excludes any discussion of\\nQuality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and\\ncontrolled at the application layer or above.\\n\\nThis document is not a product of the IRTF Information-Centric\\nNetworking Research Group (ICNRG) but has been through formal Last\\nCall and has the support of the participants in the research group\\nfor publication as an individual submission.",

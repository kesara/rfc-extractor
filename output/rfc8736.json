    "abstract": "The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header format.  The\\ncommon header definition contains eight reserved bits.  This document\\nspecifies how these bits may be used by individual message types and\\ncreates a registry containing the per-message-type usage.  This\\ndocument also extends the PIM type space by defining three new\\nmessage types.  For each of the new types, four of the previously\\nreserved bits are used to form an extended type range.\\n\\nThis document updates RFCs 7761 and 3973 by defining the use of the\\ncurrently Reserved field in the PIM common header.  This document\\nfurther updates RFCs 7761 and 3973, along with RFCs 5015, 5059, 6754,\\nand 8364, by specifying the use of the currently reserved bits for\\neach PIM message.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6166.",

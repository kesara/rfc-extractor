    "abstract": "This document discusses the applicability of Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) to the user plane of mobile networks.  The network programming nature of SRv6 accomplishes mobile user-plane functions in a simple manner.  The statelessness of SRv6 and its ability to control both service layer path and underlying transport can be beneficial to the mobile user plane, providing flexibility, end-to- end network slicing, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) control for various applications.  This document discusses how SRv6 could be used as the user plane of mobile networks.  This document also specifies the SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors required for mobility use cases. ",

    "abstract": "This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a set\\nof mechanisms for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a\\nresolver's encrypted DNS configuration.  An Encrypted DNS Resolver\\ndiscovered in this manner is referred to as a \"Designated Resolver\".\\nThese mechanisms can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to\\nencrypted DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known.  These\\nmechanisms are designed to be limited to cases where Unencrypted DNS\\nResolvers and their Designated Resolvers are operated by the same\\nentity or cooperating entities.  It can also be used to discover\\nsupport for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an Encrypted DNS\\nResolver is known.",

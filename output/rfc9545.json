    "abstract": "A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment list.  A\\nsubset of segments from the segment list cannot be leveraged to\\ndistinguish one SR path from another as they may be partially\\ncongruent.  SR path identification is a prerequisite for various use\\ncases such as performance measurement and end-to-end 1+1 path\\nprotection.\\n\\nIn an SR over MPLS (SR-MPLS) data plane, an egress node cannot\\ndetermine on which SR path a packet traversed the network from the\\nlabel stack because the segment identifiers are removed from the\\nlabel stack as the packet transits the network.\\n\\nThis document defines a Path Segment Identifier (PSID) to identify an\\nSR path on the egress node of the path.",

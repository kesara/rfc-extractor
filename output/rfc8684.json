    "abstract": "TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per\\nconnection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\\nsimultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would\\nimprove resource usage within the network and thus improve user\\nexperience through higher throughput and improved resilience to\\nnetwork failure.\\n\\nMultipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple\\npaths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to\\ntraditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers\\nthe same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable\\nbytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish\\nand use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.\\n\\nThis document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as\\nspecified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications\\nprimarily driven by deployment experience.",

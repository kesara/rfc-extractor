    "abstract": "This document specifies the derivation of the content-encryption key or the content-authenticated-encryption key in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) using the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) with SHA-256.  The use of this mechanism provides protection against an attacker that manipulates the content- encryption algorithm identifier or the content-authenticated- encryption algorithm identifier. ",

    "abstract": "This document defines a BGP path attribute known as the \"Tunnel\\nEncapsulation attribute\", which can be used with BGP UPDATEs of\\nvarious Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFIs) to provide\\ninformation needed to create tunnels and their corresponding\\nencapsulation headers.  It provides encodings for a number of tunnel\\ntypes, along with procedures for choosing between alternate tunnels\\nand routing packets into tunnels.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5512, which provided an earlier\\ndefinition of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.  RFC 5512 was never\\ndeployed in production.  Since RFC 5566 relies on RFC 5512, it is\\nlikewise obsoleted.  This document updates RFC 5640 by indicating\\nthat the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV may be included in any Tunnel\\nEncapsulation attribute where load balancing is desired.",

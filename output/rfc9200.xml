    "abstract": "This specification defines a framework for authentication and authorization in Internet of Things (IoT) environments called ACE\u2011OAuth.  The framework is based on a set of building blocks including OAuth 2.0 and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), thus transforming a well-known and widely used authorization solution into a form suitable for IoT devices.  Existing specifications are used where possible, but extensions are added and profiles are defined to better serve the IoT use cases. ",

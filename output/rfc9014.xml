    "abstract": "This document describes how Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs)\\ncan be connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) in order to extend the\\nLayer 2 connectivity required for some tenants.  The solution\\nanalyzes the interaction between NVO networks running Ethernet\\nVirtual Private Networks (EVPNs) and other Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN)\\ntechnologies used in the WAN, such as Virtual Private LAN Services\\n(VPLSs), VPLS extensions for Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB-VPLS),\\nEVPN, or PBB-EVPN.  It also describes how the existing technical\\nspecifications apply to the interconnection and extends the EVPN\\nprocedures needed in some cases.  In particular, this document\\ndescribes how EVPN routes are processed on Gateways (GWs) that\\ninterconnect EVPN-Overlay and EVPN-MPLS networks, as well as the\\nInterconnect Ethernet Segment (I-ES), to provide multihoming.  This\\ndocument also describes the use of the Unknown MAC Route (UMR) to\\navoid issues of a Media Access Control (MAC) scale on Data Center\\nNetwork Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices.",

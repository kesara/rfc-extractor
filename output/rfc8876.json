    "abstract": "Use of the Internet for emergency calling is described in RFC 6443,\\n'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'.  In some\\ncases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all\\nthat is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a\\nsituation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where,\\nunlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media\\nsuch as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP\\nMESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on\\nthe Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request\\ndoes not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE,\\nwhich does.  Any device that needs to initiate a request for\\nemergency services without an interactive media channel would use the\\nmechanisms in this document.",

    "abstract": "This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic\\nControl Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is\\nbootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509\\ncertificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing\\nservice, both online and offline.  We call this process the\\nBootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.\\nBootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address\\nand a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/\\ndisconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less\\nstringent security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is\\ncomplete when the cryptographic identity of the new key\\ninfrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The\\nestablished secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued\\ncertificate to the device as well.",

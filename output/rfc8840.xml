    "abstract": "The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the Offer/Answer model.  The ICE extension for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism that allows ICE Agents to shorten session establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel.  This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The document also defines a new SIP Info Package to support this usage together with the corresponding media type.  Additionally, a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) \"end-of-candidates\" attribute and a new SIP option tag \"trickle-ice\" are defined. ",

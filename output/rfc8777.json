A new DNS resource\\nrecord named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for\\nsource-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a\\nmulticast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource\\nrecords to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward\\nmulticast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other\\nextensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also\\ndefined.",

    "abstract": "The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC\\n7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of\\nextremely small code size, fairly small message size, and\\nextensibility without the need for version negotiation.\\n\\nIn CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.\\nRFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as\\nper RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX \"seconds since the epoch\").  Since\\nthen, additional requirements have become known.  This specification\\ndefines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for\\napplications needing a textual date representation within the\\nGregorian calendar without a time.  It also defines a CBOR tag for\\ndays since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for\\napplications needing a numeric date representation without a time.\\nThis specification is the reference document for IANA registration of\\nthe CBOR tags defined.",

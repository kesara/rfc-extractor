    "abstract": "Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications have requirements that cannot be satisfied by centralized cloud-based systems (i.e., cloud computing).  These include time sensitivity, data volume, connectivity cost, operation in the face of intermittent services, privacy, and security.  As a result, IoT is driving the Internet toward edge computing.  This document outlines the requirements of the emerging IoT edge and its challenges.  It presents a general model and major components of the IoT edge to provide a common basis for future discussions in the Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) and other IRTF and IETF groups.  This document is a product of the IRTF T2TRG. ",

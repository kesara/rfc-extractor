    "abstract": "Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications have requirements that\\ncannot be satisfied by centralized cloud-based systems (i.e., cloud\\ncomputing).  These include time sensitivity, data volume,\\nconnectivity cost, operation in the face of intermittent services,\\nprivacy, and security.  As a result, IoT is driving the Internet\\ntoward edge computing.  This document outlines the requirements of\\nthe emerging IoT edge and its challenges.  It presents a general\\nmodel and major components of the IoT edge to provide a common basis\\nfor future discussions in the Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG)\\nand other IRTF and IETF groups.  This document is a product of the\\nIRTF T2TRG.",

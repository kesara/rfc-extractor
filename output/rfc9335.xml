    "abstract": "While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides\\nconfidentiality for the contents of a media packet, a significant\\namount of metadata is left unprotected, including RTP header\\nextensions and contributing sources (CSRCs).  However, this data can\\nbe moderately sensitive in many applications.  While there have been\\nprevious attempts to protect this data, they have had limited\\ndeployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations.\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 3711, the SRTP specification, and defines\\nCryptex as a new mechanism that completely encrypts header extensions\\nand CSRCs and uses simpler Session Description Protocol (SDP)\\nsignaling with the goal of facilitating deployment.",

    "abstract": "The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply web technologies to constrained environments.  One such important technology is Web Linking (RFC 8288), which CoRE specifications use as the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the Link Format (RFC 6690) in the Constrained Application Protocol's (CoAP's) resource discovery process (Section\u00a07.2 of RFC 7252) and the Resource Directory (RD) (RFC 9176).  Web Links can have target attributes, the names of which are not generally coordinated by the Web Linking specification (Section\u00a02.2 of RFC 8288).  This document introduces an IANA registry for coordinating names of target attributes when used in CoRE.  It updates the \"RD Parameters\" IANA registry created by RFC 9176 to coordinate with this registry. ",

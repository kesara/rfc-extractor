    "abstract": "In PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) networks, PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of multicast sources in the network.  There are periodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active.  The PIM Null- Register message carries information about a single multicast source and group.  This document defines a standard to send information about multiple multicast sources and groups in a single PIM message.  This document refers to the new messages as the \"PIM Packed Null-Register message\" and \"PIM Packed Register-Stop message\". ",

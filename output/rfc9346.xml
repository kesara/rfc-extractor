    "abstract": "This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes).  It defines IS-IS extensions for the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links, which can be used to perform inter-AS TE path computation.  No support for flooding information from within one AS to another AS is proposed or defined in this document.  This document builds on RFC 5316 by adding support for IPv6-only operation.  This document obsoletes RFC 5316. ",

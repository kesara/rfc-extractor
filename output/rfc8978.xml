    "abstract": "In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6\\nprefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling\\nof that condition (such as when a Customer Edge router crashes and\\nreboots without knowledge of the previously employed prefixes), hosts\\non the local network may continue using stale prefixes for an\\nunacceptably long time (on the order of several days), thus resulting\\nin connectivity problems.  This document describes this issue and\\ndiscusses operational workarounds that may help to improve network\\nrobustness.  Additionally, it highlights areas where further work may\\nbe needed.",

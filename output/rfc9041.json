In particular,\\nthe registration procedure \"Private Use\" (previously known as \"Vendor\\nPrivate Use\") has been changed to \"First Come First Served\" for the\\nTLV and sub-TLV registries.\\n\\nIt also updates the description of the procedures for the responses\\nsent when an unknown or erroneous code point is found.  The updates\\nare to clarify and align this namespace with recent developments,\\ne.g., aligning terminology with RFC 8126 instead of the now obsoleted\\nRFC 5226 (both titled \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations\\nSection\u00a0in RFCs\").",

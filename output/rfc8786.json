One of the extensions is the Stateful PCE\\nRequest Parameters (SRP) object.  That object includes a Flags field\\nthat is a set of 32 bit flags, and RFC 8281 defines an IANA registry\\nfor tracking assigned flags.  However, RFC 8231 does not explain how\\nan implementation should set unassigned flags in transmitted\\nmessages, nor how an implementation should process unassigned,\\nunknown, or unsupported flags in received messages.\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 8231 by defining the correct behaviors.",

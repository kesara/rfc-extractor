    "abstract": "The Extensible Authentication Protocol-TLS (EAP-TLS) (RFC 5216) has\\nbeen updated for TLS 1.3 in RFC 9190.  Many other EAP Types also\\ndepend on TLS, such as EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure\\nTunneling (EAP-FAST) (RFC 4851), EAP-Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) (RFC\\n5281), the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP) (RFC\\n7170).  It is possible that many vendor-specific EAP methods, such as\\nthe Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP), depend on\\nTLS as well.  This document updates those methods in order to use the\\nnew key derivation methods available in TLS 1.3.  Additional changes\\nnecessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS)\\nversions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346).  Accordingly, those\\ndocuments have been moved to Historic status.  These versions lack\\nsupport for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and\\nmechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of\\napplications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions.\\nTLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in\\n2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018),\\nproviding sufficient time to transition away from older versions.\\nRemoving support for older versions from implementations reduces the\\nattack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and\\nstreamlines library and product maintenance.\\n\\nThis document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC\\n4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.\\n\\nThis document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version\\n1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein.  This document also\\nupdates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is\\npart of BCP 195.",

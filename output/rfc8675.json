    "abstract": "This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module \"iana-\\ntunnel-type\", which contains a collection of IANA-maintained YANG\\nidentities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces.  The module\\nreflects the \"tunnelType\" registry maintained by IANA.  The latest\\nrevision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website.\\n\\nTunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface\\nTypes YANG module; they must instead be added to the \"tunnelType\"\\nIANA registry.  Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA\\nfor a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not\\nalready listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will\\nupdate the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly.\\n\\nSome of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the\\ncurrent IANA registry.  It is not the intent of this document to\\nupdate the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel\\ntechnologies.  Registrants must follow the IETF registration\\nprocedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed.",

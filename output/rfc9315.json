    "abstract": "Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm.\\nAt the same time, terms related to Intent-Based Networking are often\\nused loosely and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and\\nconfused with other concepts such as \"policy.\"  This document\\nclarifies the concept of \"intent\" and provides an overview of the\\nfunctionality that is associated with it.  The goal is to contribute\\ntowards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and\\nfunctionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further\\ndefinition of associated research and engineering problems and their\\nsolutions.\\n\\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research\\nGroup (NMRG).  It reflects the consensus of the research group,\\nhaving received many detailed and positive reviews by research group\\nparticipants.  It is published for informational purposes.",

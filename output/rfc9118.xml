    "abstract": "RFC 8226 specifies the use of certificates for Secure Telephone Identity Credentials; these certificates are often called \"Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) Certificates\".  RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JSON Web Token (JWT) claims that can be included in the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), as defined in RFC 8225.  If the PASSporT signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the PASSporT recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document updates RFC 8226; it provides all of the capabilities available in the original certificate extension as well as an additional way to constrain the allowable JWT claims.  The enhanced extension can also provide a list of claims that are not allowed to be included in the PASSporT. ",

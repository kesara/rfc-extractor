    "abstract": "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\\n(DMARC), defined in RFC 7489, permits a domain-controlling\\norganization to express domain-level policies and preferences for\\nmessage validation, disposition, and reporting, which a mail-\\nreceiving organization can use to improve mail handling.\\n\\nDMARC distinguishes the portion of a name that is a Public Suffix\\nDomain (PSD), below which Organizational Domain names are created.\\nThe basic DMARC capability allows Organizational Domains to specify\\npolicies that apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that\\ncapability to PSDs.  This document describes an extension to DMARC to\\nfully enable DMARC functionality for PSDs.\\n\\nSome implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for\\nDMARC enforcement.  This specification addresses that case.",

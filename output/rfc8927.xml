    "abstract": "This document proposes a format, called JSON Type Definition (JTD),\\nfor describing the shape of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\\nmessages.  Its main goals are to enable code generation from schemas\\nas well as portable validation with standardized error indicators.\\nTo this end, JTD is intentionally limited to be no more expressive\\nthan the type systems of mainstream programming languages.  This\\nintentional limitation, as well as the decision to make JTD schemas\\nbe JSON documents, makes tooling atop of JTD easier to build.\\n\\nThis document does not have IETF consensus and is presented here to\\nfacilitate experimentation with the concept of JTD.",

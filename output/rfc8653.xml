    "abstract": "Applications differ with respect to whether they need session\\ncontinuity and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the\\nsame type of service to any mobile host and any application running\\non the host yields inefficiencies, as described in RFC 7333.  This\\ndocument defines a new concept of enabling applications to influence\\nthe network's mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address\\nreachability) on a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the\\nnetworking stack's API to accommodate this concept.",

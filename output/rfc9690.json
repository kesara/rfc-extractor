    "abstract": "The RSA Key Encapsulation Mechanism (RSA-KEM) algorithm is a one-pass\\n(store-and-forward) cryptographic mechanism for an originator to\\nsecurely send keying material to a recipient using the recipient's\\nRSA public key.  The RSA-KEM algorithm is specified in Clause 11.5 of\\nISO/IEC: 18033-2:2006.  This document specifies the conventions for\\nusing the RSA-KEM algorithm as a standalone KEM algorithm and the\\nconventions for using the RSA-KEM algorithm with the Cryptographic\\nMessage Syntax (CMS) using KEMRecipientInfo as specified in RFC 9629.\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5990.",

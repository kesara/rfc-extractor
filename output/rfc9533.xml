    "abstract": "This document defines extensions to the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  Knowing the measured metrics of each member link of a LAG enables operators to enforce the performance-based traffic steering policy across the member links. ",

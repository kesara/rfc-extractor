    "abstract": "RFC 5247 is updated to define and clarify EAP Session-Id derivation\\nfor multiple Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.  The\\nderivation of Session-Id was not given for EAP Subscriber Identity\\nModule (EAP-SIM) or EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA)\\nwhen using the fast reconnect exchange instead of full\\nauthentication.  The derivation of Session-Id for full authentication\\nis clarified for both EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  The derivation of\\nSession-Id for Protected EAP (PEAP) is also given.  The definition\\nfor PEAP follows the definition for other TLS-based EAP methods.",

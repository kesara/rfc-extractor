    "abstract": "This specification defines a data model and JavaScript Object\\nNotation (JSON) representation of contact card information that can\\nbe used for data storage and exchange in address book or directory\\napplications.  It aims to be an alternative to the vCard data format\\nand to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process.  In\\ncontrast to the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a direct mapping\\nfrom the vCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate.\\nTwo additional specifications define new vCard elements and how to\\nconvert between JSContact and vCard.",

    "abstract": "RFC 8231 describes a set of extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via PCEP.  One of the extensions is the LSP object, which includes a Flag field with a length of 12 bits.  However, all bits of the Flag field have already been assigned.  This document defines a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV for the LSP object for an extended Flag field. ",

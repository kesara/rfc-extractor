    "abstract": "In addition to a new cipher with a block length of n=128 bits\\n(referred to as \"Kuznyechik\" and described in RFC 7801), Russian\\nFederal standard GOST R 34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the\\nblock cipher with a block length of n=64 bits and key length of k=256\\nbits, which is also referred to as \"Magma\".  The algorithm is an\\nupdated version of an older block cipher with a block length of n=64\\nbits described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830).  This document is\\nintended to be a source of information about the updated version of\\nthe 64-bit cipher.  It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in\\nInternet applications by providing information for developers and\\nusers of the GOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version of the\\ncipher for encryption and decryption.",

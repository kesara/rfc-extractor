    "abstract": "In general, linear network coding can improve the network\\ncommunication performance in terms of throughput, latency, and\\nreliability.  BATched Sparse (BATS) code is a class of efficient\\nlinear network coding scheme with a matrix generalization of fountain\\ncodes as the outer code and batch-based linear network coding as the\\ninner code.  This document describes a baseline BATS coding scheme\\nfor communication through multi-hop networks and discusses the\\nrelated research issues towards a more sophisticated BATS coding\\nscheme.  This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient\\nNetwork Communications Research Group (NWCRG).",

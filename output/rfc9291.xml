    "abstract": "This document defines an L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) that can be used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) services within a network (e.g., a service provider network).  The L2NM complements the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) by providing a network-centric view of the service that is internal to a service provider.  The L2NM is particularly meant to be used by a network controller to derive the configuration information that will be sent to relevant network devices.  Also, this document defines a YANG module to manage Ethernet segments and the initial versions of two IANA-maintained modules that include a set of identities of BGP Layer 2 encapsulation types and pseudowire types.

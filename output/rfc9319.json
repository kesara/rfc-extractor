    "abstract": "This document recommends ways to reduce the forged-origin hijack\\nattack surface by prudently limiting the set of IP prefixes that are\\nincluded in a Route Origin Authorization (ROA).  One recommendation\\nis to avoid using the maxLength attribute in ROAs except in some\\nspecific cases.  The recommendations complement and extend those in\\nRFC 7115.  This document also discusses the creation of ROAs for\\nfacilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)\\nmitigation services.  Considerations related to ROAs and RPKI-based\\nRoute Origin Validation (RPKI-ROV) in the context of destination-\\nbased Remotely Triggered Discard Route (RTDR) (elsewhere referred to\\nas \"Remotely Triggered Black Hole\") filtering are also highlighted.",

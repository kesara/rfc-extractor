    "abstract": "This document describes a mechanism for creating, encoding, and\\nverifying digital signatures or message authentication codes over\\ncomponents of an HTTP message.  This mechanism supports use cases\\nwhere the full HTTP message may not be known to the signer and where\\nthe message may be transformed (e.g., by intermediaries) before\\nreaching the verifier.  This document also describes a means for\\nrequesting that a signature be applied to a subsequent HTTP message\\nin an ongoing HTTP exchange.",

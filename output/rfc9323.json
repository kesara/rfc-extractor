The objective is to allow for the creation of an\\nattestation, termed an \"RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC)\", which contains\\none or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files) that are\\nsigned with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.  When\\nvalidated, an RSC confirms that the respective Internet resource\\nholder produced the RSC.",

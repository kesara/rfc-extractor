    "abstract": "This document specifies two Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation\\n(ALPN) labels for use with Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC).  The\\n\"webrtc\" label identifies regular WebRTC: a DTLS session that is used\\nto establish keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)\\nor to establish data channels using the Stream Control Transmission\\nProtocol (SCTP) over DTLS.  The \"c-webrtc\" label describes the same\\nprotocol, but the peers also agree to maintain the confidentiality of\\nthe media by not sharing it with other applications.",

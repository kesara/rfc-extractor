    "abstract": "This document gives an overview of the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) architecture, which provides a secure, scalable, and spectrum-efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation.  LDACS is a scheduled and reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  It is part of a larger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based communication.  High reliability and availability of IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.  The intent of this document is to introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise awareness on related activities inside and outside of the IETF, and to seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics to IP.

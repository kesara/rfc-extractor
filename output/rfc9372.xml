    "abstract": "This document gives an overview of the L-band Digital Aeronautical\\nCommunications System (LDACS) architecture, which provides a secure,\\nscalable, and spectrum-efficient terrestrial data link for civil\\naviation.  LDACS is a scheduled and reliable multi-application\\ncellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  It is part of a\\nlarger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based\\ncommunication.  High reliability and availability of IP connectivity\\nover LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.  The intent\\nof this document is to introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise\\nawareness on related activities inside and outside of the IETF, and\\nto seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics to IP.",

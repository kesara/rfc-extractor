    "abstract": "Link-state routing protocols have hierarchical abstraction already\\nbuilt into them.  However, when lower levels are used for transit,\\nthey must expose their internal topologies to each other, thereby\\nleading to scaling issues.\\n\\nTo avoid such issues, this document discusses extensions to the IS-IS\\nrouting protocol that allow Level 1 (L1) areas to provide transit but\\nonly inject an abstraction of the Level 1 topology into Level 2 (L2).\\nEach Level 1 area is represented as a single Level 2 node, thereby\\nenabling a greater scale.",

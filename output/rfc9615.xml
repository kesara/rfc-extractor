    "abstract": "This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to publish arbitrary information about the zones for which they are authoritative, in an authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis. The mechanism allows managed DNS operators to securely announce DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management, including for zones that are not currently securely delegated.  Whenever DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this signal enables the parent's registry or registrar to cryptographically validate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex.  The parent can then provision DS records for the delegation without resorting to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks such as \"Accept after Delay\".  This document establishes the DS enrollment method described in Section\u00a04 of this document as the preferred method over those from Section\u00a03 of RFC 8078.  It also updates RFC 7344. ",

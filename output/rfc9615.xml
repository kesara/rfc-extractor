    "abstract": "This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to\\npublish arbitrary information about the zones for which they are\\nauthoritative, in an authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis.\\nThe mechanism allows managed DNS operators to securely announce\\nDNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management, including for\\nzones that are not currently securely delegated.\\n\\nWhenever DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this signal\\nenables the parent's registry or registrar to cryptographically\\nvalidate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex.  The\\nparent can then provision DS records for the delegation without\\nresorting to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks\\nsuch as \"Accept after Delay\".\\n\\nThis document establishes the DS enrollment method described in\\nSection\u00a04 of this document as the preferred method over those from\\nSection\u00a03 of RFC 8078.  It also updates RFC 7344.",

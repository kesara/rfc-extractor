    "abstract": "The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data\\nformat whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\\ncode size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\\nneed for version negotiation.\\n\\nIn CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.\\nRFC 8949 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 time as a\\nstring) and tag 1 (POSIX time as int or float).  Since then,\\nadditional requirements have become known.  The present document\\ndefines a CBOR tag for time that allows a more elaborate\\nrepresentation of time, as well as related CBOR tags for duration and\\ntime period.  This document is intended as the reference document for\\nthe IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.",

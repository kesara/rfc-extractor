    "abstract": "This document describes a framework for Enhanced Virtual Private\\nNetworks (VPNs) based on Network Resource Partitions (NRPs) in order\\nto support the needs of applications with specific traffic\\nperformance requirements (e.g., low latency, bounded jitter).  NRP-\\nbased enhanced VPNs leverage the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE)\\ntechnologies and add characteristics that specific services require\\nbeyond those provided by conventional VPNs.  Typically, an NRP-based\\nenhanced VPN will be used to underpin network slicing, but it could\\nalso be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity\\nservices between customer sites.  This document also provides an\\noverview of relevant technologies in different network layers and\\nidentifies some areas for potential new work.",

    "abstract": "Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate a network. An intent-based management system includes an interface for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration and manage their life cycle.  This document mostly discusses the concept of network intents, but other types of intents are also considered.  Specifically, this document highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and encode intent, and the associated intent taxonomy; it also defines relevant intent terms where necessary, provides a foundation for intent-related research, and facilitates solution development.  This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG). ",

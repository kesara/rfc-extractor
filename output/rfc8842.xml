    "abstract": "This document defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/ answer procedures for negotiating and establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) association.  The document also defines the criteria for when a new DTLS association must be established.  The document updates RFCs 5763 and 7345 by replacing common SDP offer/answer procedures with a reference to this specification.  This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, \"tls-id\".  This document also defines how the \"tls-id\" attribute can be used for negotiating and establishing a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection, in conjunction with the procedures in RFCs 4145 and 8122.

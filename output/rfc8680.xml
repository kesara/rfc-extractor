    "abstract": "RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction\\n(FEC) codes to provide protection against packet loss.  The framework\\nsupports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable\\ntransport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming,\\nmedia.  However, FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block FEC\\ncodes.  This document updates RFC 6363 to support FEC codes based on\\na sliding encoding window, in addition to block FEC codes, in a\\nbackward-compatible way.  During multicast/broadcast real-time\\ncontent delivery, the use of sliding window codes significantly\\nimproves robustness in harsh environments, with less repair traffic\\nand lower FEC-related added latency.",

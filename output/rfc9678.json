    "abstract": "This document updates RFC 9048, \"Improved Extensible Authentication\\nProtocol Method for 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key\\nAgreement (EAP-AKA')\", and its predecessor RFC 5448 with an optional\\nextension providing ephemeral key exchange.  The extension EAP-AKA'\\nForward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated, provides forward\\nsecrecy for the session keys generated as a part of the\\nauthentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who has\\ngained access to the long-term key from obtaining session keys\\nestablished in the past.  In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive\\nattacks (e.g., large-scale pervasive monitoring) against future\\nsessions.  This forces attackers to use active attacks instead.",

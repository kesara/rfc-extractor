    "abstract": "This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model.  The model defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series.  First, policy definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals.  Second, policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).  In addition, various responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed alone or in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE), and IETF LLC.  Finally, this document establishes the Editorial Stream for publication of future policy definition documents produced through the processes defined herein.  This document obsoletes RFC 8728.  This document updates RFCs 7841, 8729, and 8730. ",

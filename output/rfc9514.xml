    "abstract": "Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) allows for a flexible definition of\\nend-to-end paths within various topologies by encoding paths as\\nsequences of topological or functional sub-paths called \"segments\".\\nThese segments are advertised by various protocols such as BGP, IS-\\nIS, and OSPFv3.\\n\\nThis document defines extensions to BGP - Link State (BGP-LS) to\\nadvertise SRv6 segments along with their behaviors and other\\nattributes via BGP.  The BGP-LS address-family solution for SRv6\\ndescribed in this document is similar to BGP-LS for SR for the MPLS\\ndata plane, which is defined in RFC 9085.",

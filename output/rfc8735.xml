    "abstract": "Requirements for providing the End-to-End (E2E) performance assurance\\nare emerging within the service provider networks.  While there are\\nvarious technology solutions, there is no single solution that can\\nfulfill these requirements for a native IP network.  In particular,\\nthere is a need for a universal E2E solution that can cover both\\nintra- and inter-domain scenarios.\\n\\nOne feasible E2E traffic-engineering solution is the addition of\\ncentral control in a native IP network.  This document describes\\nvarious complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the\\nPath Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network.  This\\nsolution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR),\\nintegrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power\\nof a centralized control technology, providing traffic engineering\\nfor native IP networks in a manner that applies equally to intra- and\\ninter-domain scenarios.",

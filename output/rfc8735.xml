    "abstract": "Requirements for providing the End-to-End (E2E) performance assurance are emerging within the service provider networks.  While there are various technology solutions, there is no single solution that can fulfill these requirements for a native IP network.  In particular, there is a need for a universal E2E solution that can cover both intra- and inter-domain scenarios.  One feasible E2E traffic-engineering solution is the addition of central control in a native IP network.  This document describes various complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the Path Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network.  This solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control technology, providing traffic engineering for native IP networks in a manner that applies equally to intra- and inter-domain scenarios.

    "abstract": "This document introduces extensions to the Path Computation Element\\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) to support path computation in Native\\nIP networks through a PCE-based central control mechanism known as\\nCentralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR).  These extensions empower\\na PCE to calculate and manage paths specifically for Native IP\\nnetworks, thereby expanding PCEP's capabilities beyond its past use\\nin MPLS and GMPLS networks.  By implementing these extensions, IP\\nnetwork resources can be utilized more efficiently, facilitating the\\ndeployment of traffic engineering in Native IP environments.",

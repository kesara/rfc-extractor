    "abstract": "This document presents three YANG 1.1 modules to support the configuration of TCP clients and TCP servers.  The modules include basic parameters of a TCP connection relevant for client or server applications, as well as client configuration required for traversing proxies.  The data models defined by these modules may be used directly (e.g., to define a specific TCP client or TCP server) or in conjunction with the configuration defined for higher level protocols that depend on TCP (e.g., SSH, TLS, etc.).  Examples of higher level protocol configuration designed to be used in conjunction with this configuration are in RFCs 9644 and 9645. ",

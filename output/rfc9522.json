    "abstract": "This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in\\nthe Internet.  The document is intended to promote better\\nunderstanding of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP\\nnetworks and the networks that support IP networking and to provide a\\ncommon basis for the development of traffic-engineering capabilities\\nfor the Internet.  The principles, architectures, and methodologies\\nfor performance evaluation and performance optimization of\\noperational networks are also discussed.\\n\\nThis work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002.  This document\\nobsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in\\nline with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and\\nto include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.",

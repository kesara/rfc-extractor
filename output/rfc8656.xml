    "abstract": "If a host is located behind a NAT, it can be impossible for that host\\nto communicate directly with other hosts (peers) in certain\\nsituations.  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use\\nthe services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication\\nrelay.  This specification defines a protocol, called \"Traversal\\nUsing Relays around NAT\" (TURN), that allows the host to control the\\noperation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using\\nthe relay.  TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that\\nit allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single\\nrelay address.\\n\\nThe TURN protocol was designed to be used as part of the Interactive\\nConnectivity Establishment (ICE) approach to NAT traversal, though it\\ncan also be used without ICE.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 5766 and 6156.",

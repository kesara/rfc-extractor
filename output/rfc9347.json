    "abstract": "This document describes a mechanism for aggregation and fragmentation\\nof IP packets when they are being encapsulated in Encapsulating\\nSecurity Payload (ESP).  This new payload type can be used for\\nvarious purposes, such as decreasing encapsulation overhead for small\\nIP packets; however, the focus in this document is to enhance IP\\nTraffic Flow Security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality\\n(TFC) to encrypted IP-encapsulated traffic.  TFC is provided by\\nobscuring the size and frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-size,\\nconstant-send-rate IPsec tunnel.  The solution allows for congestion\\ncontrol, as well as nonconstant send-rate usage.",

    "abstract": "Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the\\nInternet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion\\ncollapse.  The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real-time\\nmultimedia, which needs low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery, are\\ndifferent from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or bursty\\ntransfers like web pages.  Due to an increasing amount of RTP-based\\nreal-time media traffic on the Internet (e.g., with the introduction\\nof the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)), it is especially\\nimportant to ensure that this kind of traffic is congestion\\ncontrolled.\\n\\nThis document describes a set of requirements that can be used to\\nevaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure out\\ntheir fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of\\npossible requirements for a real-time media congestion avoidance\\ntechnique.",

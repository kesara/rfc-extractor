    "abstract": "The Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) specification (RFC 8724) describes generic header compression and fragmentation techniques for Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies.  SCHC is a generic mechanism designed for great flexibility so that it can be adapted for any of the LPWAN technologies.  This document defines a profile of SCHC (RFC 8724) for use in LoRaWAN networks and provides elements such as efficient parameterization and modes of operation. ",

    "abstract": "A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about\\nthe placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\\nEngineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  When a PCE has stateful\\ncontrol over LSPs, it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify\\nthe attributes (especially the paths) of the LSPs.  A Path\\nComputation Client (PCC) that has set up LSPs under local\\nconfiguration may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE.\\n\\nThere are use cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain\\ncontrol of locally configured LSPs that it is aware of but have not\\nbeen delegated to the PCE.\\n\\nThis document describes an extension to the Path Computation Element\\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make requests for\\nsuch control.",

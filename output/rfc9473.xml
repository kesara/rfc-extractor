    "abstract": "Path properties express information about paths across a network and the services provided via such paths.  In a path-aware network, path properties may be fully or partially available to entities such as endpoints.  This document defines and categorizes path properties. Furthermore, the document identifies several path properties that might be useful to endpoints or other entities, e.g., for selecting between paths or for invoking some of the provided services.  This document is a product of the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG). ",

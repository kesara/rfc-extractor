    "abstract": "This document defines how to compress Constrained Application\\nProtocol (CoAP) headers using the Static Context Header Compression\\nand fragmentation (SCHC) framework.  SCHC defines a header\\ncompression mechanism adapted for Constrained Devices.  SCHC uses a\\nstatic description of the header to reduce the header's redundancy\\nand size.  While RFC 8724 describes the SCHC compression and\\nfragmentation framework, and its application for IPv6/UDP headers,\\nthis document applies SCHC to CoAP headers.  The CoAP header\\nstructure differs from IPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible\\nheader with a variable number of options, themselves of variable\\nlength.  The CoAP message format is asymmetric: the request messages\\nhave a header format different from the format in the response\\nmessages.  This specification gives guidance on applying SCHC to\\nflexible headers and how to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient\\ncompression Rules.",

These extensions\\npermit the negotiation of an application protocol variant of RADIUS\\ncalled \"RADIUS/1.1\".  No changes are made to RADIUS/UDP or RADIUS/\\nTCP.  The extensions allow the negotiation of a transport profile\\nwhere the RADIUS shared secret is no longer used, and all MD5-based\\npacket authentication and attribute obfuscation methods are removed.\\n\\nThis document updates RFCs 2865, 2866, 5176, 6613, 6614, and 7360.",

    "abstract": "The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list furthers the development and specification of Internet technology through the general discussion of technical, procedural, operational, and other topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exist.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude in terms of topics is allowed, but there are posts and topics that are unsuitable for this mailing list.  This document defines the charter for the IETF discussion list and explains its scope.  This document obsoletes RFC 3005 and updates RFC 3683. ",

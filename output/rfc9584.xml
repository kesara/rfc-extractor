    "abstract": "This document describes an RTP payload format for the Essential Video Coding (EVC) standard, published as ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1.  EVC was developed by the MPEG.  The RTP payload format allows for the packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload and the fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload format has broad applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other applications. ",

    "abstract": "This document specifies extensions to NFSv4.2 for improving Weak\\nCache Consistency (WCC).  These extensions introduce mechanisms that\\nensure partial writes performed under a Parallel NFS (pNFS) layout\\nremain coherent and correctly tracked.  The solution addresses\\nconcurrency and data integrity concerns that may arise when multiple\\nclients write to the same file through separate data servers.  By\\ndefining additional interactions among clients, metadata servers, and\\ndata servers, this specification enhances the reliability of NFSv4 in\\nparallel-access environments and ensures consistency across diverse\\ndeployment scenarios.",

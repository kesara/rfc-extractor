    "abstract": "The 3GPP mobile network Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is an\\nauthentication mechanism for devices wishing to access mobile\\nnetworks.  RFC 4187 (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible\\nwithin the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework.  RFC\\n5448 (EAP-AKA') was an improved version of EAP-AKA.\\n\\nThis document is the most recent specification of EAP-AKA',\\nincluding, for instance, details about and references related to\\noperating EAP-AKA' in 5G networks.\\n\\nEAP-AKA' differs from EAP-AKA by providing a key derivation function\\nthat binds the keys derived within the method to the name of the\\naccess network.  The key derivation function has been defined in the\\n3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  EAP-AKA' allows its use\\nin EAP in an interoperable manner.  EAP-AKA' also updates the\\nalgorithm used in hash functions, as it employs SHA-256 / HMAC-\\nSHA-256 instead of SHA-1 / HMAC-SHA-1, which is used in EAP-AKA.\\n\\nThis version of the EAP-AKA' specification defines the protocol\\nbehavior for both 4G and 5G deployments, whereas the previous version\\ndefined protocol behavior for 4G deployments only.  While EAP-AKA' as\\ndefined in RFC 5448 is not obsolete, this document defines the most\\nrecent and fully backwards-compatible specification of EAP-AKA'.\\nThis document updates both RFCs 4187 and 5448.",

    "abstract": "One mantra of the IETF is, \"We are not the Protocol Police.\"\\nHowever, to ensure that protocols are implemented and deployed in\\nfull compliance with the IETF's standards, it is important to set up\\na body that is responsible for assessing and enforcing correct\\nprotocol behavior.\\n\\nThis document formally establishes the Protocol Police.  It defines\\nthe body and sets out what aspects of IETF protocols they will\\npolice.  This document acts as a point of reference for networking\\nengineers, law enforcement officials, government representatives, and\\nothers.  It also provides advice on how to report issues to the\\nProtocol Police.",

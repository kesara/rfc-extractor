    "abstract": "This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address\\nAutoconfiguration that causes hosts to generate temporary addresses\\nwith randomized interface identifiers for each prefix advertised with\\nautoconfiguration enabled.  Changing addresses over time limits the\\nwindow of time during which eavesdroppers and other information\\ncollectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity\\ncorrelation when the same address is employed for multiple\\ntransactions by the same host.  Additionally, it reduces the window\\nof exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes\\nrevealed as a result of active communication.  This document\\nobsoletes RFC 4941.",

    "abstract": "Most HTTP authentication schemes are probeable in the sense that it\\nis possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin\\nserves resources that require authentication.  It is possible for an\\norigin to hide the fact that it requires authentication by not\\ngenerating Unauthorized status codes; however, that only works with\\nnon-cryptographic authentication schemes: cryptographic signatures\\nrequire a fresh nonce to be signed.  Prior to this document, there\\nwas no existing way for the origin to share such a nonce without\\nexposing the fact that it serves resources that require\\nauthentication.  This document defines a new non-probeable\\ncryptographic authentication scheme.",

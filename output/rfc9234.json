    "abstract": "Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate\\nassumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route\\nlearned from one transit provider to another transit provider or a\\nlateral (i.e., non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from\\none lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit provider.\\nThese are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route\\nfiltering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes).\\nExisting approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by\\noperator configuration, with no check that the configuration\\ncorresponds to that of the External BGP (eBGP) neighbor, or\\nenforcement of the two eBGP speakers agreeing on the peering\\nrelationship.  This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to\\nestablish an agreement of the peering relationship on each eBGP\\nsession between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate\\nconfiguration on both sides.  Propagated routes are then marked\\naccording to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention and\\ndetection of route leaks.",

    "abstract": "Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps that\\nare incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as\\n\"packet timestamps\" for short.  This document specifies guidelines\\nfor defining packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at\\nvarious layers.  It also presents three recommended timestamp\\nformats.  The target audience of this document includes network\\nprotocol designers.  It is expected that a new network protocol that\\nrequires a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the\\nrecommended timestamp formats.  If none of the recommended formats\\nfits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should\\nspecify the format of the packet timestamp according to the\\nguidelines in this document.",

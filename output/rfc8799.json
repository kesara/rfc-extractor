    "abstract": "There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors and semantics\\nthat are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within\\na limited region of the Internet.  Policies, default parameters, the\\noptions supported, the style of network management, and security\\nrequirements may vary between such limited regions.  This document\\nreviews examples of such limited domains (also known as controlled\\nenvironments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related\\ntaxonomy.  It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols\\nfor limited domains.  Finally, it shows the need for a precise\\ndefinition of \"limited domain membership\" and for mechanisms to allow\\nnodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including\\nboundary nodes.\\n\\nThis document is the product of the research of the authors.  It has\\nbeen produced through discussions and consultation within the IETF\\nbut is not the product of IETF consensus.",

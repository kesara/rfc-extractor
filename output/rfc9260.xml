    "abstract": "This document describes the Stream Control Transmission Protocol\\n(SCTP) and obsoletes RFC 4960.  It incorporates the specification of\\nthe chunk flags registry from RFC 6096 and the specification of the I\\nbit of DATA chunks from RFC 7053.  Therefore, RFCs 6096 and 7053 are\\nalso obsoleted by this document.  In addition, RFCs 4460 and 8540,\\nwhich describe errata for SCTP, are obsoleted by this document.\\n\\nSCTP was originally designed to transport Public Switched Telephone\\nNetwork (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks.  It is also\\nsuited to be used for other applications, for example, WebRTC.\\n\\nSCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a\\nconnectionless packet network, such as IP.  It offers the following\\nservices to its users:\\n\\n*  acknowledged error-free, non-duplicated transfer of user data,\\n\\n*  data fragmentation to conform to discovered Path Maximum\\nTransmission Unit (PMTU) size,\\n\\n*  sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with\\nan option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user\\nmessages,\\n\\n*  optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP\\npacket, and\\n\\n*  network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing\\nat either or both ends of an association.\\n\\nThe design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior\\nand resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.",

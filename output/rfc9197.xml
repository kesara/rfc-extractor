    "abstract": "In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) collects operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document discusses the data fields and associated data types for IOAM.  IOAM- Data-Fields can be encapsulated into a variety of protocols, such as Network Service Header (NSH), Segment Routing, Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve), or IPv6.  IOAM can be used to complement OAM mechanisms based on, e.g., ICMP or other types of probe packets. ",

    "abstract": "This document specifies how to use \"PKCS #5: Password-Based\\nCryptography Specification Version 2.1\" (RFC 8018) to generate a\\nsymmetric key from a password in conjunction with the Russian\\nnational standard GOST algorithms.\\n\\nPKCS #5 applies a Pseudorandom Function (PRF) -- a cryptographic\\nhash, cipher, or Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) -- to\\nthe input password along with a salt value and repeats the process\\nmany times to produce a derived key.\\n\\nThis specification has been developed outside the IETF.  The purpose\\nof publication being to facilitate interoperable implementations that\\nwish to support the GOST algorithms.  This document does not imply\\nIETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used here.",

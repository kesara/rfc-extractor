    "abstract": "When PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), including PIM Source-Specific\\nMulticast (PIM-SSM), is used in shared LAN networks, there is often\\nmore than one upstream router.  This can lead to duplicate IP\\nmulticast packets being forwarded by these PIM routers.  PIM Assert\\nmessages are used to elect a single forwarder for each IP multicast\\ntraffic flow between these routers.\\n\\nThis document defines a mechanism to send and receive information for\\nmultiple IP multicast flows in a single PackedAssert message.  This\\noptimization reduces the total number of PIM packets on the LAN and\\ncan therefore speed up the election of the single forwarder, reducing\\nthe number of duplicate IP multicast packets incurred.",

    "abstract": "On a multi-access network, one of the PIM-SM (PIM Sparse Mode)\\nrouters is elected as a Designated Router.  One of the\\nresponsibilities of the Designated Router is to track local multicast\\nlisteners and forward data to these listeners if the group is\\noperating in PIM-SM.  This document specifies a modification to the\\nPIM-SM protocol that allows more than one of the PIM-SM routers to\\ntake on this responsibility so that the forwarding load can be\\ndistributed among multiple routers.",

    "abstract": "Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.  But\\nmore than 30 years after the introduction of the DNS, a minority of\\nmankind persists in invading the realm of machine-to-machine\\ncommunication by reading, writing, misspelling, memorizing,\\npermuting, and confusing IP addresses.  This memo describes the\\nInternationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation\\n(\"I-DUNNO\"), a notation designed to replace current textual\\nrepresentations of IP addresses with something that is not only more\\nconcise but will also discourage this small, but obviously important,\\nsubset of human activity.",

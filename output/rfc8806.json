    "abstract": "Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip\\ntimes to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have\\ndifficulty getting responses from the root servers, such as during a\\nnetwork attack.  Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to\\nprevent snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root\\nservers.  In both cases, resolvers can greatly decrease the round-\\ntrip time and prevent observation of requests by serving a copy of\\nthe full root zone on the same server, such as on a loopback address\\nor in the resolver software.  This document shows how to start and\\nmaintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause problems\\nfor other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational\\nfragility for the operator.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 7706.",

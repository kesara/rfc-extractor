    "abstract": "Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using electric power lines for\\nindoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support\\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart meters for\\nelectricity.  The existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the\\nexpansion of PLC deployments due to its potential advantages in terms\\nof cost and convenience.  Moreover, a wide variety of accessible\\ndevices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.\\nThis document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over\\nconstrained PLC networks, such as those described in ITU-T G.9903,\\nIEEE 1901.1, and IEEE 1901.2.",

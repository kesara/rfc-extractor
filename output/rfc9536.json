    "abstract": "The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query\\ncapabilities for finding the list of domains related to a set of\\nentities matching a given search pattern.  Considering that an RDAP\\nentity can be associated with any defined object class and other\\nrelationships between RDAP object classes exist, a reverse search can\\nbe applied to other use cases besides the classic domain-entity\\nscenario.  This document describes an RDAP extension that allows\\nservers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship\\ndefined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related\\nobject class.  The reverse search based on the domain-entity\\nrelationship is treated as a particular case.",

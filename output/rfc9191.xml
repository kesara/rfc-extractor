    "abstract": "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,\\nprovides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication\\nmethods.  EAP-TLS and other TLS-based EAP methods are widely deployed\\nand used for network access authentication.  Large certificates and\\nlong certificate chains combined with authenticators that drop an EAP\\nsession after only 40 - 50 round trips is a major deployment problem.\\nThis document looks at this problem in detail and describes the\\npotential solutions available.",

    "abstract": "When multiple congestion-controlled Real-time Transport Protocol\\n(RTP) sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their\\ncontrols can improve the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of\\ndelay, loss, and fairness.  This document describes such a method for\\nflows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and\\nsimple as possible while minimizing the number of changes needed to\\nexisting RTP applications.  This document also specifies how to apply\\nthe method for the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA)\\ncongestion control algorithm and provides suggestions on how to apply\\nit to other congestion control algorithms.",

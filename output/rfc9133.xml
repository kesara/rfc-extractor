    "abstract": "This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of-\\nService Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that\\nDOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack\\nmitigation is active.\\n\\nParticularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or\\ndeactivate existing filtering rules during a Distributed Denial-of-\\nService (DDoS) attack.  The characterization of these filtering rules\\nis conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time (i.e., no\\nmitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel protocol.",

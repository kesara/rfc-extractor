    "abstract": "This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of- Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active.  Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or deactivate existing filtering rules during a Distributed Denial-of- Service (DDoS) attack.  The characterization of these filtering rules is conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time (i.e., no mitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel protocol. ",

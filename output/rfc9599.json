    "abstract": "The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion\\nnotification in any lower-layer or tunnelling protocol that\\nencapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to\\npropagate consistently from lower-layer protocols into IP.  Then, the\\nIP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry\\ncongestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the\\ntransport layer (L4).  Specifications that follow these guidelines,\\nwhether produced by the IETF or other standards bodies, should assure\\ninterworking among IP-layer and lower-layer congestion notification\\nmechanisms.  This document is included in BCP 89 and updates the\\nsingle paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about Explicit\\nCongestion Notification (ECN) in Section\u00a013 of RFC 3819 by replacing\\nit with a reference to this document.",

    "abstract": "This document specifies two Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for use with Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC).  The \"webrtc\" label identifies regular WebRTC: a DTLS session that is used to establish keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) or to establish data channels using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) over DTLS.  The \"c-webrtc\" label describes the same protocol, but the peers also agree to maintain the confidentiality of the media by not sharing it with other applications. ",

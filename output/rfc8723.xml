    "abstract": "In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary\\nto be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport\\nProtocol (RTP) packets, while still providing strong end-to-end\\nsecurity guarantees.  This document defines a cryptographic transform\\nfor the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that uses two\\nseparate but related cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop\\nand end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-\\nhop cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption\\nwith associated data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of future\\nSRTP transforms with different properties.",

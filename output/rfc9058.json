    "abstract": "Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) is an Authenticated Encryption with\\nAssociated Data (AEAD) block cipher mode based on the Encrypt-then-\\nMAC (EtM) principle.  MGM is defined for use with 64-bit and 128-bit\\nblock ciphers.\\n\\nMGM has been standardized in Russia.  It is used as an AEAD mode for\\nthe GOST block cipher algorithms in many protocols, e.g., TLS 1.3 and\\nIPsec.  This document provides a reference for MGM to enable review\\nof the mechanisms in use and to make MGM available for use with any\\nblock cipher.",

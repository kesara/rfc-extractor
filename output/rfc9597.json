    "abstract": "This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in\\nthe header parameters of any CBOR Object Signing and Encryption\\n(COSE) structure.  This functionality helps to facilitate\\napplications that wish to make use of CWT claims in encrypted COSE\\nstructures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures,\\nwhile having some of those claims be available before decryption and/\\nor without inspecting the detached payload.  Another use case is\\nusing CWT claims with payloads that are not CWT Claims Sets,\\nincluding payloads that are not CBOR at all.",

    "abstract": "Internet mail defines the From: header field to indicate the author\\nof the message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who\\ninitially handled the message on the author's behalf.  The Sender:\\nfield is optional if it has the same information as the From: field.\\nThis was not a problem until development of stringent protections on\\nuse of the From: field.  It has prompted Mediators, such as mailing\\nlists, to modify the From: field to circumvent mail rejection caused\\nby those protections.  In effect, the From: field has become\\ndominated by its role as a handling identifier.\\n\\nThe current specification augments the altered use of the From: field\\nby specifying the Author: field, which ensures identification of the\\noriginal author of the message and is not subject to modification by\\nMediators.  This document is published as an Experimental RFC to\\nassess community interest, functional efficacy, and technical\\nadequacy.",

    "abstract": "Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones\\nand portable devices to establish radio communication with each other\\nby touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no\\nmore than 10 cm apart.  NFC standards cover communication protocols\\nand data exchange formats and are based on existing Radio Frequency\\nIdentification (RFID) standards, including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.\\nThe standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC\\nForum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available\\nin mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This\\ndocument describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using IPv6 over\\nLow-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.",

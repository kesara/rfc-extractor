    "abstract": "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can operate in several modes.  Some\\nof these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and\\ntherefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port.\\nHowever, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-known port\\nis not required, employing such a well-known port unnecessarily\\nfacilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path\\nattacks.  This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the\\nuse of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those\\nmodes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required.",

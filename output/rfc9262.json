    "abstract": "This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path\\nsteered replication and forwarding for \"Bit Index Explicit\\nReplication\" (BIER) packets (RFC 8279); it is called \"Tree\\nEngineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication\" (BIER-TE) and is\\nintended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic\\nEngineering with BIER.\\n\\nBIER-TE introduces a new semantic for \"bit positions\" (BPs).  These\\nBPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-\\nTE) BIER in which BPs indicate \"Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers\"\\n(BFERs).  A BIER-TE \"packets BitString\" therefore indicates the edges\\nof the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by\\nBIER-TE.  BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little\\nchanges.  Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same\\ndomain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER\\n\"subdomains\" (SDs).  Except for the optional routed adjacencies,\\nBIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore\\noperate without depending on a routing protocol such as the \"Interior\\nGateway Protocol\" (IGP).",

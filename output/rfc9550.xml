    "abstract": "The replication and elimination functions of the Deterministic\\nNetworking (DetNet) architecture can result in out-of-order packets,\\nwhich is not acceptable for some time-sensitive applications.  The\\nPacket Ordering Function (POF) algorithms described in this document\\nenable restoration of the correct packet order when the replication\\nand elimination functions are used in DetNet networks.  The POF only\\nprovides ordering within the latency bound of a DetNet flow; it does\\nnot provide any additional reliability.",

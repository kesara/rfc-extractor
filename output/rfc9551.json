    "abstract": "Deterministic Networking (DetNet), as defined in RFC 8655, aims to\\nprovide bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network\\ninfrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed\\nsegments.  This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific\\nrequirements of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\\nrecommended to maintain a deterministic network.  The document will\\nbe used in future work that defines the applicability of and\\nextension of OAM protocols for a deterministic network.  With the\\nimplementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have\\na real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the\\nnetwork's ability to respect the Service Level Objective (SLO), such\\nas packet delay, delay variation, and packet-loss ratio, assigned to\\neach DetNet flow.",

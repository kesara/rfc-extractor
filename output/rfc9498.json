    "abstract": "This document provides the GNU Name System (GNS) technical\\nspecification.  GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant\\ndomain name resolution protocol that provides a privacy-enhancing\\nalternative to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.\\n\\nThis document defines the normative wire format of resource records,\\nresolution processes, cryptographic routines, and security and\\nprivacy considerations for use by implementers.\\n\\nThis specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have\\nIETF consensus.  It is published here to inform readers about the\\nfunction of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure\\ninteroperability among implementations (for example, pre-existing\\nGNUnet implementations).",

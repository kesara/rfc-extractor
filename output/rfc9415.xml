    "abstract": "This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy\\nimplications of different types of \"transient numeric identifiers\"\\nused in IETF protocols and tries to categorize them based on their\\ninteroperability requirements and their associated failure severity\\nwhen such requirements are not met.  Subsequently, it provides advice\\non possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the\\ninteroperability requirements of each identifier category while\\nminimizing the negative security and privacy implications, thus\\nproviding guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.\\nFinally, it describes a number of algorithms that have been employed\\nin real implementations to generate transient numeric identifiers and\\nanalyzes their security and privacy properties.  This document is a\\nproduct of the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group\\n(PEARG) in the IRTF.",

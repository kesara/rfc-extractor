    "abstract": "An Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) provides a unified control plane that solves the issues of Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) auto-discovery, tenant Media Access Control (MAC) / IP dissemination, and advanced features in a scablable way as required by Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) networks.  EVPN is a scalable solution for NVO3 networks and keeps the independence of the underlay IP Fabric, i.e., there is no need to enable Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the underlay network and maintain multicast states for tenant Broadcast Domains.  This document describes the use of EVPN for NVO3 networks and discusses its applicability to basic Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity requirements and to advanced features such as MAC Mobility, MAC Protection and Loop Protection, multihoming, Data Center Interconnect (DCI), and much more.  No new EVPN procedures are introduced. ",

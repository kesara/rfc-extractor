    "abstract": "In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, direct discovery of\\nresources is not practical due to sleeping nodes or networks where\\nmulticast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by\\nemploying an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains\\ninformation about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups\\nto be performed for those resources.  The input to an RD is composed\\nof links, and the output is composed of links constructed from the\\ninformation stored in the RD.  This document specifies the web\\ninterfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and\\nto register, maintain, look up, and remove information on resources.\\nFurthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD\\nare defined.",

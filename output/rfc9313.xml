    "abstract": "Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to provide customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only access and/or core network.  These technologies have their advantages and disadvantages.  Depending on existing topology, skills, strategy, and other preferences, one of these technologies may be the most appropriate solution for a network operator.  This document examines the five most prominent IPv4aaS technologies and considers a number of different aspects to provide network operators with an easy-to-use reference to assist in selecting the technology that best suits their needs.

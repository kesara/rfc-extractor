    "abstract": "This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.\\nRACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective\\nacknowledgments (SACKs) and has two parts.  Recent Acknowledgment\\n(RACK) starts fast recovery quickly using time-based inferences\\nderived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback, and Tail Loss Probe (TLP)\\nleverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to\\navoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely\\nused duplicate acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP\\ndetects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited\\nflights of data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering\\nevents.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DupAck threshold\\napproach.",

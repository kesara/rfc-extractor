    "abstract": "Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end\\nsecurity mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to\\nthe communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in\\ndelivering messages.  Establishing keys to provide such protections\\nis challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two\\nclients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same\\ntime.  In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol that\\nprovides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with forward\\nsecrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) for groups in size\\nranging from two to thousands.",

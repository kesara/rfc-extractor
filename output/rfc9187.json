    "abstract": "Sliding window protocols use finite sequence numbers to determine\\nsegment placement and order.  These sequence number spaces wrap\\naround and are reused during the operation of such protocols.  This\\ndocument describes a way to extend the size of these sequence numbers\\nat the endpoints to avoid the impact of that wrap and reuse without\\ntransmitting additional information in the packet header.  The\\nresulting extended sequence numbers can be used at the endpoints in\\nencryption and authentication algorithms to ensure input bit patterns\\ndo not repeat over the lifetime of a connection.",

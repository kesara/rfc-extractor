    "abstract": "This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers -- \"real-time communication on the Web\".  It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure that (1) all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable and (2) the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully specified and on the right publication track.  This document is an applicability statement -- it does not itself specify any protocol, but it specifies which other specifications implementations are supposed to follow to be compliant with Web Real- Time Communication (WebRTC).

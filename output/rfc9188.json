    "abstract": "A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,\\nWi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL.  It is desirable to seamlessly combine the\\nconnectivity over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to\\nimprove the quality of experience for applications that do not have\\nbuilt-in multi-path capabilities.  Such optimization requires\\nadditional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each\\npacket.  This document presents a new lightweight and flexible\\nencapsulation protocol for this need.  The solution has been\\ndeveloped by the authors based on their experiences in multiple\\nstandards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP.  However, this document\\nis not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus\\nopinion of the IETF.  This document will enable other developers to\\nbuild interoperable implementations in order to experiment with the\\nprotocol.",

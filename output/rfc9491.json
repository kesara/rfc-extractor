    "abstract": "This document describes the integration of the Network Service Header\\n(NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to\\nefficiently support Service Function Chaining (SFC) while maintaining\\nseparation of the service and transport planes as originally intended\\nby the SFC architecture.\\n\\nCombining these technologies allows SR to be used for steering\\npackets between Service Function Forwarders (SFFs) along a given\\nService Function Path (SFP), whereas the NSH is responsible for\\nmaintaining the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance\\ncontext, and any associated metadata.\\n\\nThis integration demonstrates that the NSH and SR can work\\ncooperatively and provide a network operator with the flexibility to\\nuse whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas of\\ntheir network infrastructure while still maintaining an end-to-end\\nservice plane using the NSH.",

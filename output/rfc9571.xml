    "abstract": "RFC 6374 describes methods of making loss and delay measurements on\\nLabel Switched Paths (LSPs) primarily as they are used in MPLS\\nTransport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks.  This document describes a\\nmethod of extending the performance measurements (specified in RFC\\n6374) from flows carried over MPLS-TP to flows carried over generic\\nMPLS LSPs.  In particular, it extends the technique to allow loss and\\ndelay measurements to be made on multipoint-to-point LSPs and\\nintroduces some additional techniques to allow more sophisticated\\nmeasurements to be made in both MPLS-TP and generic MPLS networks.",

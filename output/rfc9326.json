    "abstract": "In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used\\nfor recording and collecting operational and telemetry information.\\nSpecifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data\\npackets while they traverse the network.  This document introduces a\\nnew IOAM option type (denoted IOAM-Option-Type) called the \"IOAM\\nDirect Export (DEX) Option-Type\".  This Option-Type is used as a\\ntrigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally aggregated\\nwithout being pushed into in-flight data packets.  The exporting\\nmethod and format are outside the scope of this document.",

    "abstract": "This document describes the command/response protocol currently used\\nin the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and\\nother power devices often deployed in small offices and in IT\\ninstallations subject to an erratic public power supply.  The UPS\\nunits typically interface to an Attachment Daemon in the system they\\nprotect.  This daemon is in turn polled by a Management Daemon that\\nnotifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents\\nand automates system shutdown decisions.  The commands and responses\\ndescribed by this document are exchanged between the UPS Attachment\\nDaemon and the Management Daemon.  The practice current when this\\nprotocol was first developed risks weak security, and this is\\naddressed in the Security Considerations sections of this document.",

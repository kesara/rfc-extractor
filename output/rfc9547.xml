    "abstract": "Internet communications and applications have both environmental costs and benefits.  The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to explore and understand these impacts.  The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts and the evolving industry needs, and to identify areas for improvements and future work.  A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the topic and bring together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.  Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions. ",

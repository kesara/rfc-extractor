    "abstract": "This document describes OAuth client authentication and certificate- bound access and refresh tokens using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication with X.509 certificates.  OAuth clients are provided a mechanism for authentication to the authorization server using mutual TLS, based on either self-signed certificates or public key infrastructure (PKI).  OAuth authorization servers are provided a mechanism for binding access tokens to a client's mutual-TLS certificate, and OAuth protected resources are provided a method for ensuring that such an access token presented to it was issued to the client presenting the token.

    "abstract": "For operational simplification of \"sessionless\" applications using\\nBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), in this document, we\\npresent procedures for \"unsolicited BFD\" that allow a BFD session to\\nbe initiated by only one side and established without explicit per-\\nsession configuration or registration by the other side (subject to\\ncertain per-interface or global policies).\\n\\nWe also introduce a new YANG module to configure and manage\\n\"unsolicited BFD\".  The YANG module in this document is based on YANG\\n1.1, as defined in RFC 7950, and conforms to the Network Management\\nDatastore Architecture (NMDA), as described in RFC 8342.  This\\ndocument augments RFC 9314.",

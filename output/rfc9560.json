    "abstract": "The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides\\nRepresentational State Transfer (RESTful) web services to retrieve\\nregistration metadata from domain name and regional internet\\nregistries.  RDAP allows a server to make access control decisions\\nbased on client identity, and as such, it includes support for client\\nidentification features provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol\\n(HTTP).  Identification methods that require clients to obtain and\\nmanage credentials from every RDAP server operator present management\\nchallenges for both clients and servers, whereas a federated\\nauthentication system would make it easier to operate and use RDAP\\nwithout the need to maintain server-specific client credentials.\\nThis document describes a federated authentication system for RDAP\\nbased on OpenID Connect.",

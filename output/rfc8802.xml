    "abstract": "This memo describes an application-level protocol for the\\ncommunication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the\\nHyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session Description\\nProtocol (SDP).  The Quality for Service (Q4S) protocol provides a\\nmechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth, and\\npacket loss, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions\\nis violated.\\n\\nImplementation details on the actions to be triggered upon reception/\\ndetection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out of scope of\\nthis document; it is either application dependent (e.g., act to\\nincrease quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent (e.g.,\\nchange connection's quality profile).\\n\\nThis protocol specification is the product of research conducted over\\na number of years; it is presented here as a permanent record and to\\noffer a foundation for future similar work.  It does not represent a\\nstandard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.",

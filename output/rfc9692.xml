    "abstract": "This document defines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol for\\nClos, fat tree, and variants thereof.  These topologies were\\ninitially used within crossbar interconnects and consequently router\\nand switch backplanes, but their characteristics make them ideal for\\nconstructing IP fabrics as well.  The protocol specified by this\\ndocument is optimized towards the minimization of control plane state\\nto support very large substrates as well as the minimization of\\nconfiguration and operational complexity to allow for a simplified\\ndeployment of said topologies.",

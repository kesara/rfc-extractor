    "abstract": "The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software- Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the Label Switched Path (LSP) can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label- forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.  This document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along the path of the static LSP.

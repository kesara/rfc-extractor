    "abstract": "Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet\\nVirtual Private Networks (EVPNs) to deploy Ethernet Local Area\\nNetwork (E-LAN) services in large Multiprotocol Label Switching\\n(MPLS) networks.  That combination is what we refer to as \"PBB-EVPN.\"\\nSingle-Active multihoming and per Service Instance Identifier (I-SID)\\nload-balancing can be provided to access devices and aggregation\\nnetworks.  In order to speed up the network convergence in case of\\nfailures on Single-Active multihomed Ethernet Segments (ESs), PBB-\\nEVPN defines a flush mechanism for Customer MACs (C-MACs) called\\n\"C-MAC flush\" that works for different Ethernet Segment Backbone MAC\\n(B-MAC) address allocation models.  This document complements those\\nC-MAC flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN ESs are defined\\n(i.e., the attachment circuit is associated with a zero Ethernet\\nSegment Identifier (ESI)) and the C-MAC flush requires I-SID-level\\ngranularity.",

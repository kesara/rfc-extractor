    "abstract": "The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) certificate profile\\nprovides a way to attest authority over telephone numbers and related\\nidentifiers for the purpose of preventing telephone number spoofing.\\nThis specification details how that authority can be delegated from a\\nparent certificate to a subordinate certificate.  This supports a\\nnumber of use cases, including those where service providers grant\\ncredentials to enterprises or other customers capable of signing\\ncalls with STIR.",

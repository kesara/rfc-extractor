    "abstract": "This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic\\nOptimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO\\nproperty map services so that an application can decide to which\\nendpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical/ordinal cost\\nvalues but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the\\npaths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted\\nby specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g.,\\nthey may infer that several paths share common links and prevent\\ntraffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension\\nintroduces a new abstraction called the \"Abstract Network Element\"\\n(ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a\\nvector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract\\ngraph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed\\ntraffic optimization among endpoints.",

    "abstract": "IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide IPv4 connectivity\\nservices over IPv6 native networks during the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence\\nperiod.  DHCPv6 options have been defined to configure clients for\\nLightweight 4over6, Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation\\n(MAP-E), Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)\\nunicast softwire mechanisms, and multicast softwires.  However, in\\nmany networks, configuration information is stored in an\\nAuthentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, which\\nutilizes the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\\nprotocol to provide centralized management for users.  When a new\\ntransition mechanism is developed, new RADIUS attributes need to be\\ndefined correspondingly.\\n\\nThis document defines new RADIUS attributes to carry softwire\\nconfiguration parameters based on Address plus Port from a AAA server\\nto a Broadband Network Gateway.  Both unicast and multicast\\nattributes are covered.",

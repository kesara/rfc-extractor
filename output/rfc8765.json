When\\nthose records change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning\\nthe updated results when polled, as long as the polling rate is not\\ntoo high.  But, there exists no mechanism for a client to be\\nasynchronously notified when these changes occur.  This document\\ndefines a mechanism for a client to be notified of such changes to\\nDNS records, called DNS Push Notifications.",

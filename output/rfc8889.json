    "abstract": "The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be\\napplied to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the\\npackets of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a\\nsingle second node.  This document generalizes and expands this\\nmethodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets can\\nfollow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a\\nmultipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason, the technique\\nhere described is called \"Multipoint Alternate Marking\".",

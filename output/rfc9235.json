    "abstract": "This document provides test vectors to validate implementations of\\nthe two mandatory authentication algorithms specified for the TCP\\nAuthentication Option over both IPv4 and IPv6.  This includes\\nvalidation of the key derivation function (KDF) based on a set of\\ntest connection parameters as well as validation of the message\\nauthentication code (MAC).  Vectors are provided for both currently\\nrequired pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: KDF_HMAC_SHA1 and HMAC-\\nSHA-1-96, and KDF_AES_128_CMAC and AES-128-CMAC-96.  The vectors also\\nvalidate both whole TCP segments as well as segments whose options\\nare excluded for middlebox traversal.",

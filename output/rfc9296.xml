    "abstract": "RFC 5309 defines the Point-to-Point (P2P) circuit type, one of the two circuit types used in the link-state routing protocols, and highlights that it is important to identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link-state database packets, and monitoring the link state.

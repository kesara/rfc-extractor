    "abstract": "NAT64 (Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to\\nIPv4 Servers) allows client devices using IPv6 to communicate with\\nservers that have only IPv4 connectivity.\\n\\nThe specification for how a client discovers its local network's\\nNAT64 prefix (RFC 7050) defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for\\nthis purpose.  However, in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations\\nsection (Section\u00a08.1), that specification (RFC 7050) indicates that\\nthe name actually has no particularly special properties that would\\nrequire special handling.\\n\\nConsequently, despite the well-articulated special purpose of the\\nname, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain\\nNames registry as a name with special properties.\\n\\nThis document updates RFC 7050.  It describes the special treatment\\nrequired and formally declares the special properties of the name.\\nIt also adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse\\nmapping names.",

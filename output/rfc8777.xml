    "abstract": "This document updates RFC 7450, \"Automatic Multicast Tunneling\" (or AMT), by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource record named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other extensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also defined. ",

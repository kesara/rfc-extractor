    "abstract": "This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to carry a general-purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist').  The objective is to allow for the creation of an attestation, termed an \"RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC)\", which contains one or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files) that are signed with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.  When validated, an RSC confirms that the respective Internet resource holder produced the RSC. ",

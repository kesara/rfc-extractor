    "abstract": "DNS error reporting is a lightweight reporting mechanism that provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource records that fail to resolve or validate.  A domain owner or DNS hosting organization can use these reports to improve domain hosting.  The reports are based on extended DNS errors as described in RFC 8914.  When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server may be unaware of this.  To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes a method for a validating resolver to automatically signal an error to a monitoring agent specified by the authoritative server.  The error is encoded in the QNAME; thus, the very act of sending the query is to report the error. ",

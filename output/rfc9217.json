    "abstract": "In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware\\ninternetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes\\nthe properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and it\\nprovides for endpoints and applications to use these properties to\\nselect paths through the Internet for their traffic.  While this\\nproperty of \"path awareness\" already exists in many Internet-\\nconnected networks within single domains and via administrative\\ninterfaces to the network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork\\nexpands these concepts across layers and across the Internet.\\n\\nThis document poses questions in path-aware networking, open as of\\n2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and\\ndeployment of path-aware internetworks.  It was originally written to\\nframe discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group\\n(PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this\\nspace.",

    "abstract": "The UIDONLY extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol (RFCs\\n3501 and 9051) allows clients to enable a mode in which information\\nabout mailbox changes is returned using only Unique Identifiers\\n(UIDs).  Message numbers are not returned in responses and cannot be\\nused in requests once this extension is enabled.  This helps both\\nclients and servers to reduce resource usage required to maintain a\\nmap between message numbers and UIDs.\\n\\nThis document defines an experimental IMAP extension.",

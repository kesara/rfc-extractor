    "abstract": "MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) is a method of source routing a packet\\nthrough an MPLS data plane by imposing a stack of MPLS labels on the\\npacket to specify the path together with any packet-specific\\ninstructions to be executed on it.  SR-MPLS can be leveraged to\\nrealize a source-routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data\\nplanes by using an MPLS label stack as a source-routing instruction\\nset while making no changes to SR-MPLS specifications and\\ninterworking with SR-MPLS implementations.\\n\\nThis document describes how SR-MPLS-capable routers and IP-only\\nrouters can seamlessly coexist and interoperate through the use of\\nSR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-\\nover-UDP as defined in RFC 7510.",

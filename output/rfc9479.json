    "abstract": "Existing traffic-engineering-related link attribute advertisements\\nhave been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  Since the\\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\\nSegment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use\\nof the link attribute advertisements have been defined.  In cases\\nwhere multiple applications wish to make use of these link\\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support application-\\nspecific values for a given attribute, nor do they support an\\nindication of which applications are using the advertised value for a\\ngiven link.  This document introduces link attribute advertisements\\nthat address both of these shortcomings.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 8919.",

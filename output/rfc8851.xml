    "abstract": "In this specification, we define a framework for specifying\\nrestrictions on RTP streams in the Session Description Protocol\\n(SDP).  This framework defines a new \"rid\" (\"restriction identifier\")\\nSDP attribute to unambiguously identify the RTP streams within an RTP\\nsession and restrict the streams' payload format parameters in a\\ncodec-agnostic way beyond what is provided with the regular payload\\ntypes.\\n\\nThis specification updates RFC 4855 to give additional guidance on\\nchoice of Format Parameter (fmtp) names and their relation to the\\nrestrictions defined by this document.",

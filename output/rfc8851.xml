    "abstract": "In this specification, we define a framework for specifying restrictions on RTP streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  This framework defines a new \"rid\" (\"restriction identifier\") SDP attribute to unambiguously identify the RTP streams within an RTP session and restrict the streams' payload format parameters in a codec-agnostic way beyond what is provided with the regular payload types.  This specification updates RFC 4855 to give additional guidance on choice of Format Parameter (fmtp) names and their relation to the restrictions defined by this document. ",

    "abstract": "This document describes SPAKE2, which is a protocol for two parties\\nthat share a password to derive a strong shared key without\\ndisclosing the password.  This method is compatible with any group,\\nis computationally efficient, and has a security proof.  This\\ndocument predated the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) password-\\nauthenticated key exchange (PAKE) competition, and it was not\\nselected; however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and\\nother applications, it was felt that publication was beneficial.\\nApplications that need a symmetric PAKE, but are unable to hash onto\\nan elliptic curve at execution time, can use SPAKE2.  This document\\nis a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group in the Internet\\nResearch Task Force (IRTF).",

    "abstract": "The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a\\ndomain to communicate an issuance policy to Certification Authorities\\n(CAs) but only allows a domain to define a policy with CA-level\\ngranularity.  However, the CAA specification (RFC 8659) also provides\\nfacilities for an extension to admit a more granular, CA-specific\\npolicy.  This specification defines two such parameters: one allowing\\nspecific accounts of a CA to be identified by URIs and one allowing\\nspecific methods of domain control validation as defined by the\\nAutomatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to be\\nrequired.",

    "abstract": "This document describes an experimental TLS extension for the in-band\\ntransport of the complete set of records that can be validated by\\nDNSSEC and that are needed to perform DNS-Based Authentication of\\nNamed Entities (DANE) of a TLS server.  This extension obviates the\\nneed to perform separate, out-of-band DNS lookups.  When the\\nrequisite DNS records do not exist, the extension conveys a denial-\\nof-existence proof that can be validated.\\n\\nThis experimental extension is developed outside the IETF and is\\npublished here to guide implementation of the extension and to ensure\\ninteroperability among implementations.",

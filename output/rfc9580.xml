    "abstract": "This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP.  OpenPGP\\nprovides encryption with public key or symmetric cryptographic\\nalgorithms, digital signatures, compression, and key management.\\n\\nThis document is maintained in order to publish all necessary\\ninformation needed to develop interoperable applications based on the\\nOpenPGP format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an\\napplication.  It describes only the format and methods needed to\\nread, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any\\nnetwork.  It does not deal with storage and implementation questions.\\nIt does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid\\nsecurity flaws.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 4880 (\"OpenPGP Message Format\"), 5581\\n(\"The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP\"), and 6637 (\"Elliptic Curve\\nCryptography (ECC) in OpenPGP\").",

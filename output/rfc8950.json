    "abstract": "Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop\\naddress families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\\nand the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The AFI/SAFI\\ndefinitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for\\nadvertising a next-hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when\\nadvertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or\\nVPN-IPv4 NLRI.\\n\\nThis document specifies the extensions necessary to allow the\\nadvertising of IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop address\\nthat belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of\\nthe AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the next hop for\\nIPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the\\nencoding of the next hop to determine which of the protocols the\\naddress actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP\\npeers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and\\nVPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 next hop.  This document obsoletes RFC\\n5549.",

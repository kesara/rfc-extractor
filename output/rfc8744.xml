    "abstract": "This document describes the general problem of encrypting the Server Name Identification (SNI) TLS parameter.  The proposed solutions hide a hidden service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI of the fronting service to external observers.  This document lists known attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current \"HTTP co- tenancy\" solution, and presents requirements for future TLS-layer solutions.  In practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every requirement and that practical solutions will have to make some compromises. ",

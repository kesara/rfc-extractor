    "abstract": "The IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) appoints candidates to several\\nIETF leadership committees.  RFC 8713 provides criteria for NomCom\\nmembership that attempt to ensure NomCom volunteers are members of\\nthe loosely defined IETF community, by requiring in-person attendance\\nin three of the past five in-person meetings.  In 2020 and 2021, the\\nIETF had six consecutive fully online plenary meetings that drove\\nrapid advancement in remote meeting technologies and procedures,\\nincluding an experiment that included remote attendance for NomCom\\neligibility.  This document updates RFC 8713 by defining a new set of\\neligibility criteria from first principles, with consideration to the\\nincreased salience of remote attendance.  This document obsoletes\\nRFCs 8788 and 8989.",

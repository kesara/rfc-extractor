    "abstract": "A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e., \"jitter\").  As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation of these novel service properties.  This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component designer.  System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service properties.  Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet arrival-time violation detection.  This document also addresses security considerations specific to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security Considerations sections of those documents. ",

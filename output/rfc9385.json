    "abstract": "This document defines a set of cryptographic transforms for use in\\nthe Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  The transforms\\nare based on Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called \"GOST\"\\nalgorithms).  Use of GOST ciphers in IKEv2 is defined in RFC 9227.\\nThis document aims to define the use of GOST algorithms for the rest\\nof the cryptographic transforms used in IKEv2.\\n\\nThis specification was developed to facilitate implementations that\\nwish to support the GOST algorithms.  This document does not imply\\nIETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used in this\\ndocument.",

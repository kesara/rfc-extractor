    "abstract": "The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\\nencryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\\nstandpoint as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\\nmessage delivery is, by default, prioritized over security.  This\\ndocument describes an SMTP service extension, REQUIRETLS, and a\\nmessage header field, TLS-Required.  If the REQUIRETLS option or TLS-\\nRequired message header field is used when sending a message, it\\nasserts a request on the part of the message sender to override the\\ndefault negotiation of TLS, either by requiring that TLS be\\nnegotiated when the message is relayed or by requesting that\\nrecipient-side policy mechanisms such as MTA-STS and DNS-Based\\nAuthentication of Named Entities (DANE) be ignored when relaying a\\nmessage for which security is unimportant.",

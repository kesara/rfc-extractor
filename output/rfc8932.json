With these recommendations, the operator\\ncan make deliberate decisions regarding which services to provide, as\\nwell as understanding how those decisions and the alternatives impact\\nthe privacy of users.\\n\\nThis document also presents a non-normative framework to assist\\nwriters of a Recursive operator Privacy Statement, analogous to DNS\\nSecurity Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements\\ndescribed in RFC 6841.",

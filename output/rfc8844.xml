    "abstract": "This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).  Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the identity of a communicating peer.  This document defines mitigation techniques that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy. ",

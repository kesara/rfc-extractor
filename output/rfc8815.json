    "abstract": "This document recommends deprecation of the use of Any-Source\\nMulticast (ASM) for interdomain multicast.  It recommends the use of\\nSource-Specific Multicast (SSM) for interdomain multicast\\napplications and recommends that hosts and routers in these\\ndeployments fully support SSM.  The recommendations in this document\\ndo not preclude the continued use of ASM within a single organization\\nor domain and are especially easy to adopt in existing deployments of\\nintradomain ASM using PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).",

    "abstract": "This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal\\nto its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish\\ntheir adjacencies without cycling through the DOWN state while still\\ncorrectly initiating database synchronization.\\n\\nThis document additionally describes a mechanism for a router to\\nsignal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate a restart while\\nmaintaining forwarding-plane state.  This allows the neighbors to\\nmaintain their adjacencies until the router has restarted but also\\nallows the neighbors to bring the adjacencies down in the event of\\nother topology changes.\\n\\nThis document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting\\nrouter to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data\\nUnit (LSP) database synchronization with its neighbors and a\\nmechanism to optimize LSP database synchronization while minimizing\\ntransient routing disruption when a router starts.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5306.",

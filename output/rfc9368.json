This document describes a\\nversion negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to\\nselect a mutually supported version.  Optionally, if the client's\\nchosen version and the negotiated version share a compatible first\\nflight format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an\\nextra round trip.

    "abstract": "An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine-\\ngrained feedback on packet loss, timing, and Explicit Congestion\\nNotification (ECN) marks than is provided by the standard RTP Control\\nProtocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets.\\nThis document describes an RTCP feedback message intended to enable\\ncongestion control for interactive real-time traffic using RTP.  The\\nfeedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion\\ncontrol algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to\\nthe sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the\\nsender needs to perform congestion control.",

    "abstract": "This document describes a Video Frame Marking RTP header extension\\nused to convey information about video frames that is critical for\\nerror recovery and packet forwarding in RTP middleboxes or network\\nnodes.  It is most useful when media is encrypted and essential when\\nthe middlebox or node has no access to the media decryption keys.  It\\nis also useful for codec-agnostic processing of encrypted or\\nunencrypted media, while it also supports extensions for codec-\\nspecific information.",

    "abstract": "This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the United\\nStates National Security Agency (NSA) for National Security System\\n(NSS) servers that provide public key certificates, Certificate\\nRevocation Lists (CRLs), and symmetric keys to NSS clients.  Servers\\nthat support these interfaces are referred to as Secure Object\\nDelivery Protocol (SODP) servers.  The intended audience for this\\nprofile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key\\nmanagement services from NSA-operated SODP servers.  Interfaces\\nsupported by SODP servers include Enrollment over Secure Transport\\n(EST) and its extensions as well as Certificate Management over CMS\\n(CMC).\\n\\nThis profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and\\noperation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP\\n800-59).  It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that\\nprocess high-value information.  It is made publicly available for\\nuse by developers and operators of these and any other system\\ndeployments.",

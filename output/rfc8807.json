The structure of the password field is defined by an XML\\nSchema data type that specifies minimum and maximum password length\\nvalues, but there are no other provisions for password management\\nother than changing the password.  This document describes an EPP\\nextension that allows longer passwords to be created and adds\\nadditional security features to the EPP login command and response.",

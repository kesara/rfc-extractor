    "abstract": "The Multicast VPN (MVPN) specifications allow a single Point-to-\\nMultipoint (P2MP) tunnel to carry traffic of multiple IP VPNs\\n(referred to as VPNs in this document).  The EVPN specifications\\nallow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast\\nDomains (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP\\ntunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or\\nfor each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label\\nthat is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-\\nassigned label is needed for each flow.)  Since each ingress router\\nallocates labels independently, with no coordination among the\\ningress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large\\nnumber of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as,\\nor larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times\\nthe number of VPNs or BDs.  However, the number of labels can be\\ngreatly reduced if the association between a label and a VPN or BD is\\nmade by provisioning, so that all ingress routers assign the same\\nlabel to a particular VPN or BD.  New procedures are needed in order\\nto take advantage of such provisioned labels.  These new procedures\\nalso apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.  This\\ndocument updates RFCs 6514, 7432, and 7582 by specifying the\\nnecessary procedures.",

This document describes the mechanism and registers a media type, content encoding, and a structured syntax suffix to be used when transporting zstd-compressed content via MIME.  Despite use of the word \"standard\" as part of Zstandard, readers are advised that this document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is being published for informational purposes only.  This document replaces and obsoletes RFC 8478. ",

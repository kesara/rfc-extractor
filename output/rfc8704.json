    "abstract": "This document identifies a need for and proposes improvement of the\\nunicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) techniques (see RFC 3704) for\\ndetection and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38).\\nStrict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is\\noblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF\\nattempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704).\\nHowever, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF\\nstill has shortcomings.  This document describes enhanced feasible-\\npath uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a\\nmeaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC\\n3704).  The proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce\\nfalse positives regarding invalid detection in source address\\nvalidation (SAV).  Hence, they can potentially alleviate ISPs'\\nconcerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their\\ncustomers and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.  This\\ndocument updates RFC 3704.",

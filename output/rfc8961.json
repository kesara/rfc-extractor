    "abstract": "Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to\\nensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level\\nof congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been\\ndesigned to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the\\npassage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet\\n\"lost\".  Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism\\nrepresents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore,\\nno implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-\\nlevel requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for\\ngeneral use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the\\nrequirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars\\nthat best address each situation.",

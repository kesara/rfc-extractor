    "abstract": "This document updates the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area\\nNetwork (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol defined in RFCs\\n6775 and 8505.  The new extension is called Address-Protected\\nNeighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address\\nagainst address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and\\nLossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a\\ncryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of\\ntheir Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of\\nthe Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership\\nof the Registered Addresses.  Once an address is registered with the\\nCrypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of\\nthat address can modify the registration information, thereby\\nenforcing Source Address Validation.",

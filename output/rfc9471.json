    "abstract": "The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the\\naddresses of name servers that are contained within a delegated zone.\\nAuthoritative servers are expected to return all available glue\\nrecords for in-domain name servers in a referral response.  If\\nmessage size constraints prevent the inclusion of all glue records\\nfor in-domain name servers, the server must set the TC (Truncated)\\nflag to inform the client that the response is incomplete and that\\nthe client should use another transport to retrieve the full\\nresponse.  This document updates RFC 1034 to clarify correct server\\nbehavior.",

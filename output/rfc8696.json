    "abstract": "The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious\\nchallenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed\\ntoday.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport\\nand key agreement algorithms that could be broken by the invention of\\nsuch a quantum computer.  By storing communications that are\\nprotected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the\\nfuture when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.  Once\\nquantum-secure key management algorithms are available, the CMS will\\nbe extended to support the new algorithms if the existing syntax does\\nnot accommodate them.  This document describes a mechanism to protect\\ntoday's communication from the future invention of a large-scale\\nquantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key\\nagreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.",

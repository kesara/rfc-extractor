    "abstract": "Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by\\nwhich a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker\\nwho is deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech\\ndisability using an interpreter (i.e., a Communications Assistant\\n(CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language speaker and an\\naudio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using\\nsign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.\\nOften the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed\\na \"provider\" in this document.  The provider also provides a video\\nservice that allows users to connect video devices to their service\\nand subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers.  It is\\ndesirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker\\nconform to a standard so that any device may be used with any\\nprovider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers\\nwork.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and\\na provider.",

    "abstract": "This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to\\ncommunicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes\\nresponses to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a\\ndownstream intermediary how its responses should be prioritized when\\nthey are forwarded.  This document defines the Priority header field\\nfor communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent\\nmanner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing\\nresponses.  These share a common format structure that is designed to\\nprovide future extensibility.",

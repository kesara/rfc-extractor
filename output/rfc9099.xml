    "abstract": "Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 networks securely is\\navailable, whether the operator is an Internet Service Provider (ISP)\\nor an enterprise internal network.  However, IPv6 presents some new\\nsecurity challenges.  RFC 4942 describes security issues in the\\nprotocol, but network managers also need a more practical,\\noperations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or\\ndisadvantages of certain choices.\\n\\nThis document analyzes the operational security issues associated\\nwith several types of networks and proposes technical and procedural\\nmitigation techniques.  This document is only applicable to managed\\nnetworks, such as enterprise networks, service provider networks, or\\nmanaged residential networks.",

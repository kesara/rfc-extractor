    "abstract": "This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN)\\nextensions and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream\\nfailures by allowing downstream Provider Edges (PEs) to consider the\\nstatus of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when selecting the Upstream PE\\nfor a VPN multicast flow.  The fast failover is enabled by using\\n\"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks\"\\n(RFC 8562) and the new BGP Attribute, BFD Discriminator.  Also, this\\ndocument introduces a new BGP Community, Standby PE, extending BGP\\nMulticast VPN (MVPN) routing so that a C-multicast route can be\\nadvertised toward a Standby Upstream PE.",

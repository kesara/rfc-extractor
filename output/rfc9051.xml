    "abstract": "The Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2) allows\\na client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a\\nserver.  IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message\\nfolders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.\\nIMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline client to\\nresynchronize with the server.\\n\\nIMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming\\nmailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently;\\nsetting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231;\\nsearching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and\\nportions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of\\nnumbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique\\nidentifiers.\\n\\nIMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is\\nhandled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in\\nRFC 6409.",

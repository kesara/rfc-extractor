    "abstract": "This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to\\nspecify a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFBL) address as a message header\\nfield.  It also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such\\na complaint.  The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a\\nstandardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an\\naddress for a CFBL.  Currently, providing and maintaining such an\\naddress is a manual and time-consuming process for Message\\nOriginators and Mailbox Providers.\\n\\nThe mechanism specified in this document is being published as an\\nexperiment to gather feedback and gauge the interest of implementers\\nand deployers.  This document is produced through the Independent RFC\\nStream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.",

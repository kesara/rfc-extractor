    "abstract": "This document describes an architecture that exposes transport\\nprotocol features to applications for network communication.  The\\nTransport Services Application Programming Interface (API) is based\\non an asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern.  This API uses\\nMessages for representing data transfer to applications and describes\\nhow a Transport Services Implementation can use multiple IP\\naddresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths and can provide\\nmultiple application streams.  This document provides the\\narchitecture and requirements.  It defines common terminology and\\nconcepts to be used in definitions of a Transport Services API and a\\nTransport Services Implementation.",

    "abstract": "This document defines how to use the Authentication and Authorization\\nfor Constrained Environments (ACE) framework to distribute keying\\nmaterial and configuration parameters for secure group communication.\\nCandidate group members that act as Clients and are authorized to\\njoin a group can do so by interacting with a Key Distribution Center\\n(KDC) acting as the Resource Server, from which they obtain the\\nkeying material to communicate with other group members.  While\\ndefining general message formats as well as the interface and\\noperations available at the KDC, this document supports different\\napproaches and protocols for secure group communication.  Therefore,\\ndetails are delegated to separate application profiles of this\\ndocument as specialized instances that target a particular group\\ncommunication approach and define how communications in the group are\\nprotected.  Compliance requirements for such application profiles are\\nalso specified.",

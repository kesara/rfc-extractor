    "abstract": "A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed wireline access network\\nis an Ethernet-centric IP edge router and the aggregation point for\\nsubscriber traffic.  Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) for\\nsuch a BNG improves flexibility and scalability but requires various\\ncommunication between the User Plane (UP) and the Control Plane (CP).\\nChina Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a simple\\nCUPS control channel protocol to support such communication: the\\nSimple Control and User Plane Separation Protocol (S-CUSP).  S-CUSP\\nis defined in this document.\\n\\nThis document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF\\nconsensus.  S-CUSP is presented here to make its specification\\nconveniently available to the Internet community to enable diagnosis\\nand interoperability.",

    "abstract": "Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined as consistent sets of network\\nconfiguration information.  PvDs allows hosts to manage connections\\nto multiple networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a\\nhome router provides connectivity through both a broadband and\\ncellular network provider.\\n\\nThis document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs\\nthrough a Router Advertisement (RA) option.  This RA option announces\\na PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between\\nPvDs.  The option can directly carry some information about a PvD and\\ncan optionally point to PvD Additional Information that can be\\nretrieved using HTTP over TLS.",

    "abstract": "It is not uncommon for resource servers to require different\\nauthentication strengths or recentness according to the\\ncharacteristics of a request.  This document introduces a mechanism\\nthat resource servers can use to signal to a client that the\\nauthentication event associated with the access token of the current\\nrequest does not meet its authentication requirements and, further,\\nhow to meet them.  This document also codifies a mechanism for a\\nclient to request that an authorization server achieve a specific\\nauthentication strength or recentness when processing an\\nauthorization request.",

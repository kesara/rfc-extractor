    "abstract": "It is not uncommon for resource servers to require different authentication strengths or recentness according to the characteristics of a request.  This document introduces a mechanism that resource servers can use to signal to a client that the authentication event associated with the access token of the current request does not meet its authentication requirements and, further, how to meet them.  This document also codifies a mechanism for a client to request that an authorization server achieve a specific authentication strength or recentness when processing an authorization request. ",

    "abstract": "This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), a\\nvery compact and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key\\nexchange with ephemeral keys.  EDHOC provides mutual authentication,\\nforward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended for\\nusage in constrained scenarios, and a main use case is to establish\\nan Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)\\nsecurity context.  By reusing CBOR Object Signing and Encryption\\n(COSE) for cryptography, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)\\nfor encoding, and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for\\ntransport, the additional code size can be kept very low.",

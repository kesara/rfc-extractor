    "abstract": "The standards for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications\\n(IDNA) require a review of each new version of Unicode to determine\\nwhether incompatibilities with prior versions or other issues exist\\nand, where appropriate, to allow the IETF to decide on the trade-offs\\nbetween compatibility with prior IDNA versions and compatibility with\\nUnicode going forward.  That requirement, and its relationship to\\ntables maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the\\npast.  This document makes adjustments to the review procedure based\\non experience and updates IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect\\nthose changes and to clarify the various relationships involved.  It\\nalso makes other minor adjustments to align that document with\\nexperience.",

    "abstract": "In PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) networks, PIM Null-Register messages are\\nsent by the Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to\\nsignal the presence of multicast sources in the network.  There are\\nperiodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the RP to keep the\\nstate alive at the RP as long as the source is active.  The PIM Null-\\nRegister message carries information about a single multicast source\\nand group.\\n\\nThis document defines a standard to send information about multiple\\nmulticast sources and groups in a single PIM message.  This document\\nrefers to the new messages as the \"PIM Packed Null-Register message\"\\nand \"PIM Packed Register-Stop message\".",

    "abstract": "Active measurements over the public Internet can target either\\ncollaborating parties or non-collaborating ones.  Sometimes these\\nmeasurements, also called \"probes\", are viewed as unwelcome or\\naggressive.\\n\\nThis document suggests some simple techniques for a source to\\nidentify its probes.  This allows any party or organization to\\nunderstand what an unsolicited probe packet is, what its purpose is,\\nand, most importantly, who to contact.  The technique relies on\\noffline analysis of the probe; therefore, it does not require any\\nchange in the data or control plane.  It has been designed mainly for\\nlayer 3 measurements.",

    "abstract": "This document introduces a BGP capability called the \"Long-Lived\\nGraceful Restart Capability\" (or \"LLGR Capability\").  The benefit of\\nthis capability is that stale routes can be retained for a longer\\ntime upon session failure than is provided for by BGP Graceful\\nRestart (as described in RFC 4724).  A well-known BGP community\\ncalled \"LLGR_STALE\" is introduced for marking stale routes retained\\nfor a longer time.  A second well-known BGP community called\\n\"NO_LLGR\" is introduced for marking routes for which these procedures\\nshould not be applied.  We also specify that such long-lived stale\\nroutes be treated as the least preferred and that their\\nadvertisements be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the\\ncapability.  Use of this extension is not advisable in all cases, and\\nwe provide guidelines to help determine if it is.\\n\\nThis memo updates RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE\\ncommunity must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes\\nexchanged between the Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE)\\nrouters.",

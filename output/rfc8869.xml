    "abstract": "The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a common transport choice for interactive multimedia communication applications.  The performance of these applications typically depends on a well- functioning congestion control algorithm.  To ensure a seamless and robust user experience, a well-designed RTP-based congestion control algorithm should work well across all access network types.  This document describes test cases for evaluating performances of candidate congestion control algorithms over cellular and Wi-Fi networks. ",

    "abstract": "Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows some routing protocols\\n(e.g., OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-\\ndefined (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics.  The\\ncomputation is performed by routers participating in the specific\\nnetwork in a distributed manner using a Flexible Algorithm Definition\\n(FAD).  This definition is provisioned on one or more routers and\\npropagated through the network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding.\\n\\nBorder Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) enables the collection\\nof various topology information from the network.  This document\\ndefines extensions to the BGP-LS address family to advertise the FAD\\nas a part of the topology information from the network.",

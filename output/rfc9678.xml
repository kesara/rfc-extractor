    "abstract": "This document updates RFC 9048, \"Improved Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA')\", and its predecessor RFC 5448 with an optional extension providing ephemeral key exchange.  The extension EAP-AKA' Forward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated, provides forward secrecy for the session keys generated as a part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term key from obtaining session keys established in the past.  In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive attacks (e.g., large-scale pervasive monitoring) against future sessions.  This forces attackers to use active attacks instead. ",

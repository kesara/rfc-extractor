    "abstract": "In some application scenarios, it may be desirable to send multiple\\ndifferently encoded versions of the same media source in different\\nRTP streams.  This is called simulcast.  This document describes how\\nto accomplish simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in the Session\\nDescription Protocol (SDP).  The described solution uses an RTP/RTCP\\nidentification method to identify RTP streams belonging to the same\\nmedia source and makes an extension to SDP to indicate that those RTP\\nstreams are different simulcast formats of that media source.  The\\nSDP extension consists of a new media-level SDP attribute that\\nexpresses capability to send and/or receive simulcast RTP streams.",

    "abstract": "This document defines a new HTTP header field named \"Expect-CT\", which allows web host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to expect valid Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts.  Expect-CT allows web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency (CT) deployments.  Further, web host operators can use Expect-CT to ensure that if a UA that supports Expect-CT accepts a misissued certificate, that certificate will be discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.

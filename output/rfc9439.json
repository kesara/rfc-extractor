    "abstract": "The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\\nOptimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different\\ntypes of cost metrics.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)\\ndefines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic \"routingcost\"\\nmetric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint\\ncost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers\\nbetter performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base\\nprotocol does not define the cost metric to be used.\\n\\nThis document addresses this issue by extending the specification to\\nprovide a variety of network performance metrics, including network\\ndelay, delay variation (a.k.a.\u00a0jitter), packet loss rate, hop count,\\nand bandwidth.\\n\\nThere are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements\\nor a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance\\nmetric.  This document introduces an additional \"cost-context\" field\\nto the ALTO \"cost-type\" field to convey the source of a performance\\nmetric.",

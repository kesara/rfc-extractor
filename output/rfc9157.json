    "abstract": "This document changes the review requirements needed to get DNSSEC\\nalgorithms and resource records added to IANA registries.  It updates\\nRFC 6014 to include hash algorithms for Delegation Signer (DS)\\nrecords and NextSECure version 3 (NSEC3) parameters (for Hashed\\nAuthenticated Denial of Existence).  It also updates RFCs 5155 and\\n6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms, and updates RFC\\n8624 to clarify the implementation recommendation related to the\\nalgorithms described in RFCs that are not on the standards track.\\nThe rationale for these changes is to bring the requirements for DS\\nrecords and hash algorithms used in NSEC3 in line with the\\nrequirements for all other DNSSEC algorithms.",

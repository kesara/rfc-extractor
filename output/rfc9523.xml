    "abstract": "The Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4), as defined in RFC 5905,\\nis the mechanism used by NTP clients to synchronize with NTP servers\\nacross the Internet.  This document describes a companion application\\nto the NTPv4 client, named \"Khronos\", that is used as a \"watchdog\"\\nalongside NTPv4 and that provides improved security against time-\\nshifting attacks.  Khronos involves changes to the NTP client's\\nsystem process only.  Since it does not affect the wire protocol, the\\nKhronos mechanism is applicable to current and future time protocols.",

    "abstract": "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,\\nprovides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication\\nmethods.  This document specifies the use of EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3\\nwhile remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of\\nEAP-TLS.  TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security and\\nprivacy, and reduced latency when compared to earlier versions of\\nTLS.  EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS 1.3) further improves security\\nand privacy by always providing forward secrecy, never disclosing the\\npeer identity, and by mandating use of revocation checking when\\ncompared to EAP-TLS with earlier versions of TLS.  This document also\\nprovides guidance on authentication, authorization, and resumption\\nfor EAP-TLS in general (regardless of the underlying TLS version\\nused).  This document updates RFC 5216.",

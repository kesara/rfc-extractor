    "abstract": "Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has\\nno staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel\\nto the location to perform the initial install and configuration,\\neven in shared facilities with \"remote-hands\" (or similar) support.\\nIn many cases, this could be avoided if there were an easy way to\\ntransfer the initial configuration to a new device while still\\nmaintaining confidentiality of the configuration.\\n\\nThis document extends existing vendor proprietary auto-install to\\nprovide limited confidentiality to initial configuration during\\nbootstrapping of the device.",

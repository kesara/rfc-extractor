    "abstract": "This document describes the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)\\nMap-Versioning mechanism, which provides in-packet information about\\nEndpoint-ID-to-Routing-Locator (EID-to-RLOC) mappings used to\\nencapsulate LISP data packets.  This approach is based on associating\\na version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and transporting such a\\nversion number in the LISP-specific header of LISP-encapsulated\\npackets.  LISP Map-Versioning is particularly useful to inform\\ncommunicating Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers\\n(ETRs) about modifications of the mappings used to encapsulate\\npackets.  The mechanism is optional and transparent to\\nimplementations not supporting this feature, since in the LISP-\\nspecific header and in the Map Records, bits used for Map-Versioning\\ncan be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs that do not support or do not\\nwant to use the mechanism.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6834, which is the initial experimental\\nspecifications of the mechanisms updated by this document.",

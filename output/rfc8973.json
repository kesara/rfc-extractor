The discovery\\nprocedure also covers the DOTS signal channel Call Home.  It can be\\nuseful to know the appropriate DOTS server for a given location in\\norder to engage mitigation actions.  This is true even in cases where\\nthe DOTS client cannot localize the attack: cases where it only knows\\nthat some resources are under attack and that help is needed.",

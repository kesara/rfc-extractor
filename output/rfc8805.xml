    "abstract": "This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially termed a \"geolocation feed\".  Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures.  This format intentionally only allows specifying coarse-level location.  Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds.  This document describes a currently deployed format.  At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.

    "abstract": "This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish\\na mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation\\ninformation, colloquially termed a \"geolocation feed\".  Interested\\nparties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other\\ngeolocation data sources and procedures.  This format intentionally\\nonly allows specifying coarse-level location.\\n\\nSome technical organizations operating networks that move from one\\nconference location to the next have already experimentally published\\nsmall geolocation feeds.\\n\\nThis document describes a currently deployed format.  At least one\\nconsumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation\\ndata pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to\\ninform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.",

It\\ndefines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC\\nBoard (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet\\nSociety in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF\\nstandards process.  It also defines the membership and selection\\nrules for the IETF LLC Board.\\n\\nThis document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.",

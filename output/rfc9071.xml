    "abstract": "This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified in RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model, enabling source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources.  The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time text session.  The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the Contributing Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet for source identification.  The method makes use of the same \"text/t140\" and \"text/red\" formats as for two-party sessions.  Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP- mixer model.  The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the fully specified solution in this document because it can be applied to a wide range of existing RTP implementations.  A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multiparty-coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method.  The capability is indicated by the use of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media attribute, \"rtt-mixer\".  This document updates RFC 4103 (\"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\").  A specification for how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multiparty aware is also provided. ",

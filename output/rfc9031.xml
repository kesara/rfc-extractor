    "abstract": "This document describes the minimal framework required for a new\\ndevice, called a \"pledge\", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the\\nTime-Slotted Channel Hopping mode of IEEE 802.15.4) network.  The\\nframework requires that the pledge and the JRC (Join Registrar/\\nCoordinator, a central entity), share a symmetric key.  How this key\\nis provisioned is out of scope of this document.  Through a single\\nCoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) request-response exchange\\nsecured by OSCORE (Object Security for Constrained RESTful\\nEnvironments), the pledge requests admission into the network, and\\nthe JRC configures it with link-layer keying material and other\\nparameters.  The JRC may at any time update the parameters through\\nanother request-response exchange secured by OSCORE.  This\\nspecification defines the Constrained Join Protocol and its CBOR\\n(Concise Binary Object Representation) data structures, and it\\ndescribes how to configure the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack\\nfor this join process to occur in a secure manner.  Additional\\nsecurity mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal framework.",

    "abstract": "RFC 8954 imposed size constraints on the optional Nonce extension for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).  OCSP is used to check the status of a certificate, and the Nonce extension is used to cryptographically bind an OCSP response message to a particular OCSP request message.  Some environments use cryptographic algorithms that generate a Nonce value that is longer than 32 octets.  This document also modifies the \"Nonce\" section of RFC 6960 to clearly define and differentiate the encoding format and values for easier implementation and understanding.  This document obsoletes RFC 8954, which includes updated ASN.1 modules for OCSP, and updates RFC 6960. ",
